	<h1>How To Teach Your Horse To Jump Higher</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">You need to have a very secure riding position before jumping. Build a grid with and ground lines along the side to discourage the horse from running out or ideally make a chute similar to a free jumping lane to jump down. Flat work helps deepen that partnership and trust with your horse. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach your horse to jump higher</strong>. 
								
																	You need your horse to be relaxed and listening to you before you start jumping. 
																	The design of the Swedish oxer is similar to a cross pole in that it helps the horse to pick up his knees as the perceived height of the fence is higher. 
																	The standard advice is to always be jumping one level higher at home than you are at shows. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Be careful and remember not all horses want to jump and not all horses are as well-behaved and safe as Flora is. 
																	You can train your horse to jump by having them first become comfortable trotting and cantering over ground poles then slowly working your way towards a small jump over a cross rail. 
																	This means having a quiet but strong steady leg in the full seat and half seat also known as two point. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Proper Position Proper Riding. 
																	Once they have become comfortable with this you can begin incrementally increasing the height of the jumps. 
																	Always compete at the level below the one you are working on at home so that you are able to cope at the competition where there are many more distractions. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This will teach your horse to keep going at a controlled pace after each jump. 
																	Add a placing pole in between the second oxer and the Swedish oxer. 
																	Some videos in the beginning might be a bit out of orderHis sire is Cicero ZHow we went from barely getting over a pole on the ground to jumping 1m20I back. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This will teach your horse keep going at a controlled pace after each jump. 
																	Once your horse has a feel for jumping and knows really where to put his feet remove the trotting poles and the add individual jumps around the arena. 
																	My horse does the sameI just put it down to the fact he is very green when it comes to jumpingSo far he has jumped only about half a dozen timesWhen I first tried he just ran through them but he has got better so I would think it comes down to practise. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If he rushes to the next obstacle halt him after each jump until he learns to not speed off. 
																	Once your horse has a feel for going over a jump and knows where to put his feet take away the trotting poles and set up five or six individual jumps around the arena. 
																	Even if your thing is dressage mix your horses schooling up with hacking and jumping as it will keep him relaxed and interested.

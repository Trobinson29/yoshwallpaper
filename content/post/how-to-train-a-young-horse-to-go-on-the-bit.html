																	<strong>How to train a young horse to go on the bit</strong>. 
								
																	Then go back where you started and go forward again slowly reaching towards him. 
																	Your goal is to apply just enough steady pressure that your horse gives to the bit on his own. 
																	Right-angle turns to teach the horse to bend and correctly align his body by encouraging the hind legs to step under towards the center of gravity. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In horses of any age bit chewing can signify anxiety. 
																	If you usually ride your horse in a very thick bit try changing it for something thinner and more mobile. 
																	A healthy horse is more likely to keep up with their bit training so exercise your horse regularly. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If your horse tends to be a bit mouthy and nips teaching a horse to give a kiss upon the cheek might not be safe so find an alternative that keeps the kisses away from the handlers face. 
																	Even if your horse seems physically prepared to perform at his current level he may not be ready mentally. 
																	Then straighten your horses neck and tip his nose back to the center by bringing your other hand back to a midpoint on that thigh. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Simple transitions walk-halt halt-walk to teach the horse to react to the leg seat and rein aids promptly. 
																	A cold frosty bit is not a nice experience even for a well-trained horse. 
																	A firm feel of the bit which maintains the connection from you horses hind legs his engine into your hands. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If he doesnt the reins will be loopy shortenbut be sure to combine shortening with riding him forward from your legs. 
																	The trained horse should then start moving up to receive his treat. 
																	One stallion generally is the head a herd of mares but the lead mare determines the direction the herd goes.

																	Is your horse heavy in your hands. 
																	You can use the approach and retreat method for petting him. 
																	Two simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses.

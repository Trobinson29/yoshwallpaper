	<h1>Best Bit For Ex Racehorse</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">So many riders dont understand that it isnt the bit that stops the horse. A well-fitted pelham is a great place to start giving the rider many options for letting up on the pressure as the horse becomes more cooperative. If you want to add flavor to make biting a more pleasant experience its easy to smear on a bit of molasses jam or honey. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>According to the advice of Mel Gee it is very important to choose horse races that serve to double the profits in a single race horse picks with odds superior to 185 per race are the best bet.</b></h3>

																	<strong>Best bit for ex racehorse</strong>. 
								
																	For most horses start with a 45 inch 1013cm bit and switch as necessary. 
																	Its a double jointed bit that is shaped to sit more like a single join in the mouth applying more concentrated pressure at the bars while being shaped to suit those horse with a fatter tongue. 
																	In result of this the Waterford is a relatively strong and severe bit for a horse so is best to use for those very strong horses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Over 5000 horses leave the racing industry annually but sadly many of them face an uncertain future. 
																	The Racehorse Sanctuary provides a lifeline for such horses. 
																	Having ridden a lot of these horses Raven stood out due to the following reasons that will give you a bit of a guide to look for should you be looking to. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The bit should sit in the horses mouth so that it effects a slight smile on the horse. 
																	Usually a smaller horse has a smaller mouth and will need a smaller bit and the reverse for larger horses. 
																	Once the bit is touching the corners of the horses mouth the handler should adjust it upward until it is about one-sixteenth of an inch higher than the corners would be in a natural state. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The Verbindend is one of Bit Banks top sellers- its available in the snaffle as in the link above as well as in pony sizes and as a bridoon. 
																	An example of a Waterford is the Korsteel Waterford Loose Ring Snaffle RRP 1699 Choosing The Right Bit Ring. 
																	A metal bit may be less likely to encourage a horse to actually chew on the bit. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For these more naturally aggressive ex-racehorses we want a bit that gives us a combination of weight and leverage that will direct the horses nose down where it belongs relaxing the lower jaw. 
																	I suggest that the side reins be adjusted quite loosely at first. 
																	As one of the leading organisations working in this field our work is vital to thoroughbred welfare as we have rehomed hundreds of horses since being established. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	My 7 tips for working with an ex-racehorse in the dressage arena would be. 
																	Well I used a Pelham on my thoroughbred when I evented and a Twisted Full-Cheek Snaffle when we went on the trails thats another English bit If your horse is well trained use a softer bit. 
																	HttpwwwhorsemartcoukLiz Halliday of the Chelwood Equestrian Centre shows us how to bit a horse that leans grabs or is strong.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Your horse may need more or less feed depending on whether hes an easy keeper or a hard keeper.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much feed do horses need a day</strong>. 
								
																	As a rule of thumb allow 15 to 2 kg of feed per 100 kg of the horses body weight. 
																	Feed horses according to their work schedule. 
																	If a horse is worked in the morning feed it one-third of the concentrate and a small portion of hay in the morning and a larger portion of hay with the grain at the noon feeding. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In the winter months many horses will need extra energy to help them maintain their body temperature without decreasing body weight or creating stress due to discomfort for multiple days cold stress. 
																	A mature horse can eat 3 of its body weight daily. 
																	A horse can eat anywhere from 15-25 pounds of hay a day which generally equates to a half of a 4550-pound square bale of hay per day 15-30 bales per month. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	On average it has been estimated that the average horse will need about 25 higher energy intake during the coldest winter months. 
																	Depending on how much work you do with your horse some forage may be replaced by concentrate feed. 
																	The minimal maintenance daily water requirement of a sedentary adult horse in a thermoneutral environment is 5 L100 kg body wtday assuming the horse is consuming at least 15 of its body wt in feed dry matter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In very cold weather water heaters may be needed to prevent the water from freezing. 
																	A good rule of thumb is to feed your horse the amount of hay she can clean up in about 1Â½ - 2 hours. 
																	Horses minis and ponies need at least 1-15 pounds of hay or pasture on dry matter basis per 100 pounds of body weight every day. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This is only a rough guide. 
																	However a 500-kg horse will usually drink 2129 L of water per day when fed a mixed haygrain ration or pasture. 
																	Horses are able to consume about 15 to 2 of their body weight in dry feed feed that is 90 dry matter each day. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	However some hays may be deficient in an essential nutrient or depending on the breeding status and activity level some horses may need more or less hay in order to be in good body condition. 
																	Horses should be fed a minimum of twice a day. 
																	However if your horse needs to lose weight it may be necessary to restrict forage intake.

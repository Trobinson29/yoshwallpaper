						<h3 class="h5"><b>For the beginner its probably best to leave starting young horses to more experienced trainers.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>What is the best age to train a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Do this even if the horse is already broken but it is new to you. 
																	But first they must get accustomed to have a saddle on their backs. 
																	Fortunately outright abuse where the horse has been repeatedly beaten or even tortured is very rare. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The first six weeks of a colts life under saddle are the most important in his career. 
																	The age that horses are started in training varies considerably between breeds and disciplines and is often dictated by customs or the desire to compete in important futurities or races for young. 
																	But really we train our horseseven extensively trained ones each time we interact. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses will look at scary things and want to explore or run away from them. 
																	Abused horses are the hardest to train. 
																	When it comes to horses older usually means ten to fifteen years old but many horses in their twenties are still great riding horses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Some horses fight to save themselves in the face of abuse and it can be hard to stop fighting. 
																	If you have a foal or horse younger than 4 or 5 years old dont worry about riding and focus on building trust and confidence through simple leading and grooming. 
																	In my experience horses who are 3 or 4 years old are at the prime age to start ridingtheyre old enough to mentally and physically handle the work but theyre usually not yet strong enough to resist horribly and they havent become too set in their ways to learn. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	My personal preference in areas such as this is to first say its perfectly fine to race two year olds but it should be done only when the best interest of the horse has been assured. 
																	But therapy horses must trust their handlers and learn that new things wont hurt them and must never never choose jumping or spinning away as the first option. 
																	Start with placing a saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	With that in mind it is my recommendation that the associations should be approached with the proposal that it is fine to race 2 year olds but only when their X-rays clearly place them in category A. 
																	Older horses are more likely to be calm. 
																	You should spend a significant amount of time gaining the horses trust before starting to train it.

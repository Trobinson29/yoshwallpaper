						<h3 class="h5"><b>According to the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture a full-grown horse should eat about 12 to 15 pounds 54 to 68 kg of hay a day.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much feed does a horse eat per month</strong>. 
								
																	Horses are able to consume about 15 to 2 of their body weight in dry feed feed that is 90 dry matter each day. 
																	Start with the amounts given for the weight and lifestyle of the horse. 
																	In all scenarios in winter months horses should be given at least 15 to 3 of their body weight in some form of forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Feed 1 pound of Triple Crown Lite per 500 pounds of body weight ideally you will feed 3-4lbs of Lite daily to your draft. 
																	For example a 3-month-old would ideally be eating about three pounds of feed per day in addition to milk and free choice hay or pasture. 
																	DONT feed more than 11 pounds of grain per day or 4-5. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Feeding young horses is a balancing act as the nutritional start a foal gets can have a profound effect on its health and soundness for the rest of its life. 
																	If the nutrient quality is poor then the horse will require more hay by weight. 
																	Visit the FAQs for tips on how to feed forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It could be in the form of long stem hay chopped hays forage based cubes or combinations thereof. 
																	Horses are fed more in winter to keep them warm and they will not eat nearly as much in the summer. 
																	For an even smaller feeding rate Triple Crown 30 supplement is another great option. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A horse can eat anywhere from 15-25 pounds of hay a day which generally equates to a half of a 4550-pound square bale of hay per day 15-30 bales per month. 
																	Always remember to take into consideration the quality of your hay. 
																	Forage should be the foundation of every horse ponys diet and fed ad-lib as much as they will eat where ever possible. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For good doers total forage intake should not be restricted to less than 15 of bodyweight DM per day. 
																	They should also have access to salt at all times and unlimited ice free water. 
																	As a rule of thumb allow 15 to 2 kg of feed per 100 kg of the horses body weight.

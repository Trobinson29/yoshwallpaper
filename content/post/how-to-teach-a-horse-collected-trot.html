	<h1>How To Teach A Horse Collected Trot</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Get your horse to trot on the spot. All the judge is looking for is that the horse can bring his weight enough off his shoulders to be able to for example perform a 10-meter circle without struggling or make a downward transition from canter to walk as in a simple change without pitching forward and putting all his weight onto either his front feet or the reins. Tips to keep in mind. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach a horse collected trot</strong>. 
								
																	Developing your medium trot Dont hurry the trot to create the medium strides but use the same principle of teaching collected trot just the other way. 
																	Another way to teach your horse to lengthen his stride is with ground poles. 
																	If you step away suddenly the other person will lean or even step toward you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When all the components are in place you will be able to encourage greater expression by the way you use your seat and your half halts. 
																	Keep a steady tempo speed and consistent contact and continue to trot around your circle. 
																	If a horse does not have a great degree of natural expression in his trot you can enhance it by training strengthening and suppling work and developing true throughness. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Close your hand close your lower leg tighten your back muscles and sit a little heavier in the saddle. 
																	In medium and extend trot the horse lengthens his stride so he covers more ground with each step. 
																	Your horse should be listening enough to your aids to follow the track youve determined for him rather than meandering aimlessly around the arena. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	By using the half-halt correctly you can develop your horses collection in the trot. 
																	The half-halt shifts the horses weight back onto his hind legs activating his belly muscles lifting his back and raising his neck and forehand. 
																	You can teach your horse to reach toward the contact in a similar way. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Start with a single pole on the ground. 
																	The horse should maintain a steady tempo regardless of the type of trot. 
																	Then go over it in posting trot keeping a light contact with his mouth and maintaining your own upright position and steady balance. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Push for a few strides then bring him back on his hind legs again and then repeat. 
																	You can always help your horse with the whip a little bit but dont teach him to run away from it. 
																	This aid should only last a stride but repeat if needed.

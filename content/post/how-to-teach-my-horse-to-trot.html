													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach my horse to trot</strong>. 
								
																	Once your horse seems comfortable with halting and trotting you can work on getting your horse to trot on the spot. 
																	Just one thing to specify when you turn around and push the hip do it until they move forward and the very instant they decide to go forward just take off in a strait line. 
																	Shorten the reins by 1 to 2 in 25 to 51 cm then squeeze your legs to signal it to trot. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Encourage her to grab some mane at least with one hand in case she loses her balance backwards. 
																	Try to reduce the amount of strides between each halt and trot and also shorten the trot stride. 
																	Practice this first at the walk see how many laps around the arena she can do without sitting down goal should be 2-3 laps each way. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Some horses take to trot poles immediately and others need time to accept their use. 
																	To train your horse on how to trot in hand stand on his left side holding his lead rope with your right hand just a few inches below his snap while you hold the extra length of the lead rope in your left hand. 
																	By keeping a light contact you encourage your horse to stretch his nose forward onto the bit thus connecting the energy from his hindquarters over his back withers and poll. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The sitting trot will strengthen our core and help our balance. 
																	This helps him create more push in his hind legs and thus longer trot steps. 
																	Once you get on and ride your horse through this the hardest thing will be to keep the tempo of the trot through the trot poles. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Before you start teaching trot poles to your students youll need to be sure the horse they ride is confident over trot poles. 
																	Dont force yourself to post and keep the pressure on your stirrups steady as you rise up and down. 
																	I am working with Legend on how to properly lead next to me. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Just because your lesson horse is well trained in other areas dont expect him to automatically accept trot poles. 
																	Keep your horse at a slow and steady trot at first. 
																	Cue your horse to trot by squeezing your legs or giving it a gentle kick.

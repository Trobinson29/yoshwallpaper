																	<strong>How to get a young horse to lead</strong>. 
								
																	Teaching a young horse to pick up the correct lead. 
																	He always picks up the correct lead on the right whether it be riding or lunging but on the left I cannot get him to pick it up. 
																	If youve ever experienced a horse who has pulled or barged over you or tanked off when leading youll know that it can be annoying worrying or even dangerous. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Trot around cones figure eight around barrels open mailboxes and carry bags full of noisy trash. 
																	I start them out in a fairly large circle at a trot then I make sure that I am balanced and cue for the lope. 
																	The question is about leading your horse and why Caroline teaches. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Ive been training a 4 year old Quarter Horse and lately weve run into an issue with his left lead. 
																	The halter sometimes known as the headcollar is the harness that you will place over the horses head around the muzzle and up over the poll and ears. 
																	Training a Horse to Lead Once your horse understands the need to give to pressure you can train him to lead in-hand. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It promotes confidence in a young horse that lacks training and worldly experience. 
																	Get a nice soft halter. 
																	If the horse still refuses to walk forward on the lead line flick the whip or rope so it touches the horses rump. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Again standing at the shoulder of the horse facing forward hold the whip or the end of your leadrope in your left hand. 
																	Natural Bend - When a horse is moving around a corner or on a circle the natural bend of the body will usually make the horse pick up the correct lead automatically. 
																	Charles Wilhelm shows how to properly lead a horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Keep in mind however that ponying is an advanced skill. 
																	Pick up a coat hanging on the fence Keeley says.

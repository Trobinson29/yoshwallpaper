						<h3 class="h5"><b>The rules for a trail ride are simple.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to train a horse to trail ride alone</strong>. 
								
																	Continue swapping positions back to front for the entire trail ride. 
																	2 Your job as the rider is not to let your horse look at everything new and decide it is OK. 
																	Introducing Your Horse to Trail Riding. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The horse should willingly maintain a loose rein walk without an increase in speed. 
																	A good trail horse will go willingly over obstacles around rocks down canyons and especially through water. 
																	Absolute and quick obedience -- 100 compliance without an argument should be the goal. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This stop is done by grabbing one rein specifically and pulling the horses head around and to your knee. 
																	This motion keeps your horse from being able to bolt buck or rear. 
																	By the end of the conditioning period a daily ride of about half the distance of an average day on the trail is sufficient For a horse that is too thin for serious trail riding increase the feed and exercise to gain more conditioning before the ride. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Show your horse that going down the trail is the better option. 
																	Double check your saddle and equipment before mounting your horse to make sure everything is tight and tucked in. 
																	As the previous horse reaches the front of the line the tailender starts for the front. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Anytime you move your hands behind the saddle horn you tell your horse to stop his forward motion. 
																	Ask him to walk off the direction you want down the trail. 
																	If your trail horses attention is on the place or buddy hes leaving behind use his nervous energy to teach him that being with his rider is the best place to be. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Working your horse in the round pen with his buddy teaches him to seek comfort from you not his pal. 
																	Teach your horse to. 
																	Before you go for your first trail ride your horse should be relaxed enough to rest head at neutral eyes half closed with you just sitting on them in a relaxed manner.

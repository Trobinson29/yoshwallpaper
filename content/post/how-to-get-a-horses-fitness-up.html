																	<strong>How to get a horses fitness up</strong>. 
								
																	Week 1 Around 20mins roadwork in walk each day Week 2 Increase roadwork to 30-40mins per day. 
																	However where in the past a hack for a dressage horse consisted of the walk to the. 
																	Then move on to SET 2.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Ride in a brisk trot on good ground in three intervals of six minutes with a walk break in-between. 
																	If youve ever been to a gym after a long absence or started up a new exercise routine as part of your New Years resolution you have a good appreciation for the importance of gaining and maintaining fitness. 
																	For example practice leg yields transitions and circles to help keep you and your horse interested while you also increase fitness. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Interval training is a great way to build up your horses heart rate. 
																	Do exercises at each gait that improve flexibility and strength. 
																	This will also improve bone strength and slowly build up muscles.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Amino acids which make up proteins are the basic building blocks of muscle. 
																	Alternate between walking and trotting your horse to slowly build up its fitness level. 
																	The same concept applies to your horse when you put him back into training after giving him the winter off after a layoff from an injury or when starting a young horse under saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To get your horse fit start by walking it for 10 to 20 minutes a day. 
																	Making horses walk-on in an active manner will still increase horse fitness and it is definitely advisable to try to maintain this motion for as long as possible. 
																	For example you might ride your horse on Wednesday Thursday and Friday.

																	After it can easily do a 5 mi 80 km ride in an hour or less increase the distance by 1 mile 16 km at a time. 
																	Any fitness programme must be tailored to the horse its breed its age and how long it has been off work. 
																	An overweight horse will need to shed some pounds during his workouts while a thin horse may need increased feed - especially in the area of fats.

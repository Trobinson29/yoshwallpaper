	<h1>How To Halter Break A Young Colt</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Introducing a horse to a rope and halter at this age when the horse weighs only a few hundred pounds is much easier than wrestling with a 600-pound weanling or yearling that has never felt a human touch. I dont separate them. When we teach a colt to lead we always break to the hip Which means slide your hand down the colts side and push their hip over as you pull pressure on the rope around their neck. <br>

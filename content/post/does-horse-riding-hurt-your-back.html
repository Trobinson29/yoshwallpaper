																	<strong>Does horse riding hurt your back</strong>. 
								
																	No the horses back is certainly not hurt. 
																	Common Horseback Riding Injuries Horseback riding is not without its risks especially if youre involved in some of the more extreme versions of it like jumping or cross-country riding. 
																	This does not always need to be the case. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The Center CORE STRENGTH Anything where you are keeping yourself from being bounced off is going to primarily use your core and your legs explained Kelly Turner an ACE certified personal trainer and fitness journalist. 
																	This great method helps to prevent as well as to cure the back pain. 
																	Theres a simple simulation in the following video that explains this really well. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you are riding bareback thinking that it is more comfortable for your horse you are wrong. 
																	Lets first have a brief look at the back and pelvis. 
																	Common Horseback Riding Injuries Frequent riders are susceptible to injury due to a fall kick etc and to injuries such as a herniated disc that develop longitudinally. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can read about how that happened in just over six weeks on the link underneath the seminar. 
																	However it is a different sensation so some horses may feel a little funny at first. 
																	Key points to the video below. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can PREVENT that damage AND find happiness and well-being for you and your horse on the way. 
																	If you have upper back pain after horse riding the cause is having a slumped posture. 
																	There are a number of reasons riders experience pain related to horse riding its a common problem that most people think is part of the riding experience and can involve the knees ankles neck but more commonly the back. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Instead of sitting upright with arms and shoulders relaxed riding driving computer work or even mobile phone use puts your upper back into a more rounded position. 
																	Milly is an example of a horse healing WHILE they are being ridden. 
																	Choosing the right equipment and clothing can definitely help minimize sore spots.

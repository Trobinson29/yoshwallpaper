																	<strong>How to train your horse for trail riding</strong>. 
								
																	This is a key indication he respects you as leader. 
																	Two simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses. 
																	By making sure you are their leader you will have an easier time getting them to obey you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Then you can head out on the trails. 
																	The horse wants to remove the pressure and will take action to make the pressure stop. 
																	Ground driving can be a good confidence-building exercise for a timid trail horse because it puts him out front while youre still within range to offer encouragement. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I would not suggest trick training with excessively aggressive or nippy horses because hand feeding treats often aggravates the situation. 
																	Your goal is to put some miles under his feet. 
																	Make sure your horse can be driven from behind reliably and safely. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A good trail horse will go willingly over obstacles around rocks down canyons and especially through water. 
																	Whether youre riding or working your horse from the ground make him keep his nose in front of his body between the two points of his shoulders. 
																	You want to give your horse a job and get him moving his feet. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its also fun to teach your horse unique tricks and even non-horse people enjoy watching horses perform them. 
																	Theres no limit to how you can make a trail ride interesting and educational. 
																	Just like we monitor our horses fitness level make sure your dog is fit enough for long rides at speed if thats your goal. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Weave through trees circle bushes walk over a fallen tree branch - then stop on a loose rein and walk back over it. 
																	Remember something sticky feet will get you into trouble every single time. 
																	A horse will likely lose weight while on a ride Loch added.

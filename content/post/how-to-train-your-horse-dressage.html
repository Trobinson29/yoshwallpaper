						<h3 class="h5"><b>So if you are teaching your horse the basics of a well trained english horse you are doing dressage.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to train your horse dressage</strong>. 
								
																	When teaching any horse the object is to have the horse respond to our aids. 
																	All horses in order to ride safely need to have an understanding of basic aids and in the training of a dressage horse the understanding of these aids are built through movements and layers added upon them as strength develops. 
																	These cues can come from both legs one leg the position of your body or your seat bones the way you weight your body momentary increase or release of pressure from the hands or the core musclesthe list of possible aids goes on and on and teaching the horse to respond to every single one reliably and in a relaxed way is all part of dressage training for a horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Slightly turn your hips in the direction you want your horse to go. 
																	Here is one of my favorite cavalletti exercises. 
																	The rider must not only give clear distinct signals but must match their energy to the. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	By riding small turns like changing hands by riding a S you actually invite your horse to keep trotting small. 
																	In the beginning you can better ride your circles and turns a bit bigger. 
																	In this article Ill give you guidelines to develop a training plan for the Second Level horse looking toward Third Level but the general principles apply to the training of a horse at any level. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once you get a reaction from the horse stop the aid and sit still. 
																	The horse should stay relaxed and calm during the rein-back. 
																	Use your hips to turn the horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Dressage horses are simply horses in upper levels who have been so highly trained and are ridden by a rider who knows how to connect mind and body. 
																	Each pair of legs is raised and returned to the ground alternately while the horse stays straight and moves on one track. 
																	When you want your horse to turn pull your waist up a bit in the saddle every time. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The rhythm should always be in an appropriate tempo ie. 
																	The best way to impress a dressage judge is to put in the work at home train your horse correctly along the dressage Scales of Training and then demonstrate that. 
																	The trotcantertrot transition may seem easy but like I tell my students there is a reason it is still in the Grand Prix test.

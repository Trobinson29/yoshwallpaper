																	<strong>How to teach your horse to lead properly</strong>. 
								
																	To lead your horse forward correctly stand next to the horses left shoulder- not his neck head or stomach- look forward and walk forward confidently perhaps with a cluck. 
																	With photos Ill demonstrate the mistakes youre probably making then show you the correct way. 
																	Hold the lead rope with your right hand.

																	Charles Wilhelm shows how to properly lead a horse. 
																	If your horse still doesnt want to walk forward. 
																	The question is about leading your horse and why Caroline teaches. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its physically impossible to pull a horse forward by the lead rope and pulling a horse forward usually confuses them. 
																	Standing on the left hand side of your horse take the line in your right hand and hold it a foot or two away from his chin. 
																	Hold a dressage whip in your left hand and take up a gentle hold of the lead rope. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Take hold of the remaining line in your left hand. 
																	When you ask your horse to back up or step to the side he should float away from your cue like a rubber ducky being pushed in a bathtub not like a brick being pushed through sand. 
																	Standing by the horses shoulder take a deliberate step forward and exert gentle steady pressure on the lead rope. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	First of all you need to attach a lead line to the halter. 
																	Leading a poorly trained or ill-mannered horse can be one of the most stressful parts of your day. 
																	Never wrap the lead rope around your handif your horse decides to bolt you could get dragged by your horse and seriously injure yourself. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When you lead your horse he should walk beside you quietly paying attention to you.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>I would defiantly go with 2 acres so you could rotate him.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much land do you need to keep a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Another idea you could do is if you have like 10 horses to an acre is to fence off parts of that acre to keep the horses separate. 
																	A height of 37 m is adequate. 
																	Beyond the land you need to provide some shelter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The rule of thumb for Texas is 1 acre per horse but in Fort Worth for instance requires 10000 square feet of land per large animal and the animal must be kept 50 feet away from a regulated structure and with a quarter mile of the owners if the owner does not live on the property. 
																	If you keep a horse on your own property be sure to post any warning signs that are required in your state to help keep you from being liable should your horse injure someone. 
																	It is an unwritten rule that a minimum of one acre is a suitable amount of grazing for one horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If your soil is rocky dry or swampy the acreage isnt going to matter because there wont be good pasture but your horses will still need plenty of room to move. 
																	According to Washington State Universitys Managing Small-Acreage Horse Farms the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse although a larger space would be more desirable. 
																	Unfortunately it is not quite as simple as this although it can be used as a very rough guide. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you got more than one horse like 2 you could have 2 acres but 1-2 horses is good for 2 acres. 
																	At the farm i work at she has about 3 acres of land w 20 horses out at once but all separated. 
																	Like keep him in one pasture1 acre for about 3 weeks to 4 and then put him in the other pasture for that mush time and so on and so on. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	One acre is 43560 square feet or approximately 210 feet x 210 feet. 
																	And like everyone else said too depends on your climate. 
																	In Montana where the growing season is shorter you need at least 5 acres per horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For working horses yard size should be increased to 35 square metres. 
																	They will be ridden daily and will be supplemented with good quality hay and grain. 
																	In smaller turnout pens its critical to remove manure frequently to avoid a buildup which can attract flies or produce an odor.

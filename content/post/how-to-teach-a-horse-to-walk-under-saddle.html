						<h3 class="h5"><b>Training a yearling colt can develop a mature horse that is ready for riding lessons has great ground manners and has a deeper connection with the horse owner.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a horse to walk under saddle</strong>. 
								
																	Getting on a horse squeezing with your leg and praying the horse works out what to do before you smack it one with a stick is not a good way to break a horse. 
																	If you want a horse that gaits I think it is far easier to buy one that is bred to gait. 
																	Leading under wands held in an arch is great. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Before you try to start a horse under saddle make sure its at least 2 years old and comfortable being touched and using a halter reins and lead ropes. 
																	But if you want a good project I reckon you could try to teach a non-gaited horse to gait but I have doubts about the success of such a. 
																	Learn what a correct frame looks like when ridden and how to use rhythm and tempo to improve the contact to the bit. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For a horse to comply with your requests under saddle he must fully accept you as his leader. 
																	Sometimes you can have someone lead you and you ask for the walk first then they start walking to help teach the horse to react to the pressure. 
																	Then tighten the girth in intervals and give your horse time to walk and jog with the saddle on. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Usually when the rider gives a light squeeze with their legs an amenable horse walks on. 
																	I suspect that at some point last year your horse challenged the dominance of your husband and continued to test his leadership skills on the leader of his herd you to see if he could bump up his ranking and become the alpha. 
																	I have a 6 yr old horse who never was really in front of the leg but now she gets sticky refuses to go into trot will spook and will stop and rear if I escalate things. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The chewing and bending exercises are now practiced in walk under saddle. 
																	Once your horse is ready place the saddle on its back while praising it. 
																	In response many trainers will tell you to get after your horse often with a whip. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	My horse is green and I worked on the lunge alot first with verbal ques to walk trot etc. 
																	To teach your horse to side pass start by sitting in the saddle and turning your horse so its facing a fence or wall. 
																	Press a bit more and the horse goes faster.

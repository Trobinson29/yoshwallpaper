																	<strong>How to get your horse to lead properly</strong>. 
								
																	Begin with your horse haltered with a sturdy lead rope snapped to the ring on the underside of the halter. 
																	If the horse steps forward praise the horse and walk forward with him. 
																	To safely lead your horse through a narrow opening it is advisable for you to walk through the opening first then let your horse walk through when he is calm. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once your horse has gotten used to the halter place it over its head and muzzle and attach the lead line. 
																	X Research source Make sure to quickly move to the side of the opening after you move through and before you cue your horse to move forward. 
																	Hold a dressage whip in your left hand and take up a gentle hold of the lead rope. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	SO many horse owners and equestrians are caught leading incorrectly have troubles getting their. 
																	Your goal is to keep him there with you no matter your pace. 
																	Start by strengthening his weak lead when youre not in the saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Training a Horse to Lead. 
																	We humans are sometimes a lot less consistent. 
																	To train a horse to lead start by petting your horses head so it gets used to being touched where the halter will go. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To lead the horse stand at his side with his head or front of his neck in line with your body. 
																	A properly trained horse will require only a slight nudge on one side to pick up the canter. 
																	If you dont set the agenda for the things you do with and for your horse the horse will take over the lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Standing on the left-hand side near side of the horse hold the lead rope about 8 inches from the snap with your right hand. 
																	Lungeing is a great way to help your horse establish the correct canter lead without the worry of a rider as well as helping him build muscle and increase his flexibility. 
																	If he lags behind you may need to use the slack of your rope or use a training stick andor string to give him a few rhythmic taps as far back as you can reach.

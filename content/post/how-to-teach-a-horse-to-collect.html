					<p align="justify">Turn your horse on a large circle using your legs to maintain the same marching tempo. Ask your horse for medium strides for approximately half a circle by relaxing your seat and nudging with your inside leg to ask him to move forwards. Once you ride a horse that is truly collected you will wonder how your training program ever got along without it. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>It can help your horse begin to feel what its like to reach under with the hind legs and tilt the pelvis even if just a little.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a horse to collect</strong>. 
								
																	Master HorsemanClassical Dressage Trainer Will Faerber demonstrates how to encourage your horse to raise its back engage its hind end and get connected. 
																	Youll let the fence stop your horse then use your leg and rein to ask him to collect himself on his hindquarters execute a 180-degree rollback and continue in the opposite direction. 
																	Teach him that when the work becomes a little harder he must keep his activity and alignment. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Move one hand very slightly forward toward your horses mouth releasing a tiny bit of pressure but not so much that you create a loop in the rein. 
																	Your leg aids will also engage your horses belly muscles to allow him to raise his back. 
																	This video goes into great detail explaining what true collection really is and how to teach it to your horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	They tighten lean or brace the neck or jaw. 
																	Concentrate on your position and the clarity of your aids. 
																	The ultimate goal is collection but in the beginning it is just a soft feel. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses often resist collection if they are forced into a fixed shape and held there beyond their comfort zones. 
																	Ride your horse forward at this level of collection just for a few strides then go back to working or medium trot or canter. 
																	Close your thighs and tighten your tummy to ask your horse to collect his canter for three to four strides. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When your horse is beginning collection simply making the circle slightly smaller or riding a slight shoulder-fore may be enough. 
																	Why You Need This Rollbacks are the easiest way to start teaching your horse to move his front end work off his hindquarters and collect himself. 
																	His body will shorten from front to back as his back rises and his hind legs step further under his belly thereby lowering his croup. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The first step to teaching a horse how to collect is to teach him to give to the bit period. 
																	True collection is a way of riding your horse that teaches him to round his back lower his croup and travel with his hocks farther under his body. 
																	When done correctly collection also teaches a horse to flex at the poll relax his lower jaw and become soft supple and light.

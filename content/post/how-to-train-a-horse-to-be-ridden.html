													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to train a horse to be ridden</strong>. 
								
																	Two simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses. 
																	If it happens fast be overjoyed but brace yourself for a long training period. 
																	Horses are trained to be manageable by humans for everyday care as well as for equestrian activities from horse racing to therapeutic horseback riding for people with disabilities. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horse training refers to a variety of practices that teach horses to perform certain behaviors when commanded to do so by humans. 
																	Start training your horse as soon as possible - Its important for your horse to trust you and by building a positive relationship immediately after you meet the horse this will become possible. 
																	Start with placing a saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Any sport such as jumping combined driving reining dressage or distance riding that puts extra stress on a horses joints shouldnt be started until the age of four or five or more depending on the individual. 
																	The lunge whip is used solely when lunging or doing liberty work with a horse. 
																	Look where you want to go. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The hard or the gentle way. 
																	To teach a horse to ride tackless spend time riding and getting to know your horse first. 
																	We now have in training a 6-year-old who has never been ridden and the jury is still out on whether hell have the maturity to make it easier or whether a life of vacation has created a horse whos not interested in work. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The whip is pointed towards the front of the horse to ask for slow and towards the back to ask for an increase in speed. 
																	Every ride every time. 
																	Theyre not active in their intention and the horse feels he has to look out for himself as a result says Field. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Ask him to yield his hips shoulders or ribs. 
																	Ride circles figure eights serpentines or other patterns until he begins to yield then ask him again to ride away from the comfort zone created by his horse friends and familiar barn. 
																	Give your horse at least 3-4 rides per week for 2 months if you really want to change its tolting.

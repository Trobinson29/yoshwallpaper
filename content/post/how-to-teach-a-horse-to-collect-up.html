	<h1>How To Teach A Horse To Collect Up</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">True collection is a way of riding your horse that teaches him to round his back lower his croup and travel with his hocks farther under his body. When done correctly collection also teaches a horse to flex at the poll relax his lower jaw and become soft supple and light. Move one hand very slightly forward toward your horses mouth releasing a tiny bit of pressure but not so much that you create a loop in the rein. <br>

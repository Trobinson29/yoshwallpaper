					<p align="justify">If you are talented and consistently getting 70 percent at Second Level you might be able to reach Grand Prix within three years if you are riding a trained schoolmaster. If your scores average around 58 percent at Second Level you will take a lot longer or not reach Grand Prix at all. There is some truth to the fact that horses do these things by themselves. <br>

																	<strong>How long does it take to train a horse for dressage</strong>. 
								
																	All the movements you see being performed in a dressage arena are movements that horses are capable of doing at liberty. 
																	Many injuries are just bad fortune and the horse that stays sound or has only minor issues for short periods of time is more likely to achieve the higher degree of strength and fitness needed to perform at Grand. 
																	Notice also how well muscled and flexible the horse is. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In her excellent book Equine Fitness Jec Aristotle Ballou stresses that it can take as long as 12 months for a horse to become fit enough to be ridden in walk trot and canter for a full hour. 
																	Other activities such as hacking on the trail cavalletti or quadrille work add spice to the program and improve fitness. 
																	Dressage ˈ d r ɛ s ɑː ʒ or d r ɪ ˈ s ɑː ʒ. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The rider of a Training Level horse can apply this philosophy and substitute easier exercises and movements. 
																	That often results in the horse picking up an injury that can sometimes end a promising dressage career. 
																	And yet most riders expect their horses to perform this long after only a few months. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As an equestrian sport defined by the International Equestrian Federation dressage is described as the highest expression of horse training. 
																	In general most horses will do well with three or four days of dressage training per week. 
																	In general most horses regardless of level progress quite well with three or four days of training per week. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	How Long Does It Take to Train A Dressage Horse. 
																	It usually takes around five years to train a horse to Grand Prix level assuming that you dont suffer any setbacks along the way. 
																	They are so basic and so useful that even the most expert horses still need the practice. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A French term most commonly translated to mean training is a form of riding performed in exhibition and competition as well as an art sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery. 
																	Luck can play a part. 
																	It really depends on the horse and rider.

	<h1>What Age Should You Break A Horse</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Typically people will put them under saddle lightly at the age of 6. So you can use a bareback pad and just get the horse used to that at any age as long as you do it in a way that the horse is always calm and accepting and doesnt jump. Low-impact work done in short intervals helps young horses develop their joints and muscles. <br>

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>What age should you break a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Although you can start a horse under saddle before 4 or 5 years of age its important to remember they are still developing at that age and therefore your training regimen must not be too severe for their developing bodies to handle. 
																	You should spend a significant amount of time gaining the horses trust before starting to train it. 
																	Can fully mature at 5 or a bit later. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If training begins too early horses can face physical problems like joint pain and bone spurs. 
																	Clydes dont fully mature til the age of 8 at least. 
																	If you follow these suggestions you will have a horse that trusts you and is more obedient. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you have a foal or horse younger than 4 or 5 years old dont worry about riding and focus on building trust and confidence through simple leading and grooming. 
																	If your horses knees have not closed it means that the knees have not fully developed and are extremely vulnerable to damage that can occur as a result of putting too much pressure on the joints. 
																	If you want the horse to follow toe commands you should use them at this time. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	An arabs knees close at 2 but they are slow growers too. 
																	You should start handling it from the time its born. 
																	You need to start training a horse to get ridden or break a horse at the age of 2 to 3 years old. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In my experience horses who are 3 or 4 years old are at the prime age to start ridingtheyre old enough to mentally and physically handle the work but theyre usually not yet strong enough to resist horribly and they havent become too set in their ways to learn. 
																	Typically people will put them under saddle lightly at the age of 6. 
																	An arabs knees close at 2 but they are slow growers too. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I have attempted to halter break horses that were 4 and 5 years old. 
																	Regardless of the age of the horse it is essential that you do not ride a horse whose knees have not finished closing. 
																	Do this even if the horse is already broken but it is new to you.

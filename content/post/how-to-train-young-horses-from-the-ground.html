																	<strong>How to train young horses from the ground</strong>. 
								
																	Its easy and fun to teach your horse to neck rein. 
																	Horses are naturally herd animals. 
																	Two simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Approach the horse from the left side holding the halter in your left hand so the horse can see it clearly. 
																	Put your horse on a lead rope and if necessary grab a crop. 
																	Its also fun to teach your horse unique tricks and even non-horse people enjoy watching horses perform them. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Body conformation is a factor. 
																	Everything from leading to ponying to loading the young horse can make him a better old horse. 
																	When the horse is about three years old it will be trained to accept the saddle pad and saddle on his back the girth under his belly and the stirrups hanging next to his body. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	How to Train A Horse the Best Way Possible There are many ways you can train a horse but each horse and trainer are different so you may need to use a variety of techniques in your situation to get the best results. 
																	Ground work isnt putting a halter and lead rope on a horse and walking him around the pasture for half an hour nor is it about longeing your horse in a circle until hes sweating and exhausted. 
																	Here hes teaching Yield the Hindquarters using steady pressure above and the Sending Exercise below. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In the Foal Training Series Clinton explains how to teach the Fundamentals modified for a young horse. 
																	If they do not respond to this then apply pressure on their shoulder. 
																	Whether you ride English or western its handy to have a horse that can both direct rein and neck rein. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A horse with little or no ground manners presents a set of challenges that may at first seem insurmountable. 
																	It is a relatively easy test of the skeletal maturity of young horses.

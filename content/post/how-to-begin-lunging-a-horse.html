	<h1>How To Begin Lunging A Horse</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Once your horse is comfortable and relaxed at the walk you can send him out onto the circle. Start by lunging the horse in a light contact on a big circle. Hold the line firmly in one hand without wrapping it around your wrist so you can let additional line out as needed. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>The horse comes in on the circle Use the lunge whip to keep the horse out by pointing it at his shoulder.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to begin lunging a horse</strong>. 
								
																	That is you can work a horse a little harder lunging schooling transitions transitions within the gait introducing side reins more canter trotting poles etc both mentally and physically. 
																	This is typically done by standing at the horses shoulder pointing with your leading hand and using the other hand to tap the horse on the neck or shoulder with the lunge whip until they move out. 
																	The lunge line should be attached to the centre ring on the cavesson. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Hold the lunge line in your left hand in big loops so that your horse does not trip over it and hold the whip pointed towards the ground in your right. 
																	When you want to control the horses movement use voice commands like stand walk on and whoa You can also control the speed of your horse by moving your feet faster or slower. 
																	If youre lunging a horse with the halter run the chain on the end of a lunge line through the square opening on the one side of the halter over the horses nose bring it through the other side same square opening and attach it back to itself. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The lunge whip in the other. 
																	Now that your horse has spent ten minutes loosening up you can do 5 to 7 minutes of more advanced work. 
																	All lunging sessions start with your horse standing still in the center of the arena. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	At 3 the purpose of lunging can even up in the way it mentally and physically impacts a horse. 
																	Lead your horse out and around the circle working on body language as you walk. 
																	The correct position for lunging a horse will form a triangle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once youre ready have the horse walk around you in a circle. 
																	But also when lunging is too short it can happen that the horse hasnt reached the relaxation it needs to start moving correctly. 
																	The endorphin flow released by the forward-downward position hasnt started yet and so the horse misses those feel good hormones that make sure that lunging is relaxing and pleasant. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If its a young horse you are teaching to lunge ask someone to stand by their outside shoulder to guide them and keep them out on the circle in walk. 
																	You want your horse to be comfortable around the lunge line and the circle before you ask for any advanced gaits. 
																	Start your lunging session at just a walk.

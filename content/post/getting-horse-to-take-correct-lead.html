						<h3 class="h5"><b>If the horse is on the wrong lead the canter will feel uncomfortable and unbalanced.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>Getting horse to take correct lead</strong>. 
								
																	Horses tend to have a stonger and a weaker side just as we are right handed or left handed. 
																	Riders cue their horses to encourage this sequence and quickly learn to recognize by sight and feel when a lead is wrong. 
																	It is extremely common for riders to try to get their horses to take a specific lead by turning them in the direction of the lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	How to Lead Begin with your horse haltered with a sturdy lead rope snapped to the ring on the underside of the halter Standing on the left-hand side near side of the horse hold the lead rope about 8 inches from the snap with your right hand. 
																	This is a tactful way of saying that they pull on the inside rein. 
																	You might not see him run to a sliding stop or spin four times in a pasture but I bet youve seen your horse change leads when hes running and playing. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If your horse is cantering on the correct lead the canter will feel smooth and nicely balanced. 
																	The outside hind leg in order to end up on the correct lead Stay in this left lead canter position for a few strides in the walk and then switch your aids as if asking for right lead canter Remember youre doing all of this in the walk. 
																	Lungeing is a great way to help your horse establish the correct canter lead without the worry of a rider as well as helping him build muscle and increase his flexibility. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Hold the end of the lead rope folded to fit comfortably in your left hand. 
																	Teaching your horse to lope off on the correct lead can be achieved in three simple steps. 
																	The moment he does get the correct lead give him plenty of praise. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	But unless the rider has control of the horses outside shoulder the result is often not the desired one. 
																	Now take up a circle. 
																	Lead changes come naturally to a horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It will take time for him to develop the strength and understanding to pick it up reliably but this is an important skill that he must master. 
																	Right rein flexes the horses head one inch to the right. 
																	The set-up the cue and the release.

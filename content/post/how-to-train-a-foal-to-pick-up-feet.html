																	<strong>How to train a foal to pick up feet</strong>. 
								
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground. 
																	Many people struggle with picking up their horses feet and using an understa. 
																	Pat Parelli shares a couple of horse training tips and horse training methods. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Michelle Quirico MQ Training is based out of the North Bay at American Canyon Training Center in Napa CA. 
																	Hesitate just a moment so that your horse notices that youve stopped rubbing. 
																	Make sure that you are suitable clothed and working in a safe area. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To do this have your horse on a lead rope in a level area. 
																	On the back legs the cue for the horse to pick up his foot is to lightly squeeze the cap of his hock. 
																	Pinch or twist your horses chestnut just enough to make him notice and lift his foot in response. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Secondly teach your horse that not picking up their feet it actually going to result in much more work for them. 
																	This is easier with a partner but it can be done solo. 
																	Marlis Amato demonstrates how to eliminate heaviness leaning and resistance to having a foot off the ground whether for routine hoof care or for the farr. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can start picking up your foals leg as early as when he is a day or two old. 
																	Once you can run your hand down a foals legs and it remains relaxed it is time to start teaching them to pick up their feet. 
																	Ask your horse to pick up its feet. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Start by gently squeezing the cap of the hock then increase the pressure by squeezing harder and harder. 
																	As soon as the horse responds by taking his weight off his leg immediately release the pressure and rub his leg. 
																	If it refuses immediately make them move out in a trot around you.

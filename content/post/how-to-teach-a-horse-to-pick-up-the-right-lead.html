	<h1>How To Teach A Horse To Pick Up The Right Lead</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">From here you should teach your horse the cue for forwards halt left and right by applying gentle consistent pressure to the lead line in the direction you want the horse to go. For example to teach your horse to move forward hold the lead rope under its chin then pull it forward until your horse steps forward. When you are ready to ask for the canter you must pick the right moment because the horse who is now ready to respond immediately will take the lead according to where his legs are when you ask. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Now lets talk about how to get that correctly-arced body position so your horse can easily and smoothly pick up the correct lead.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a horse to pick up the right lead</strong>. 
								
																	Shes a very strong rider and since Im obviously waaaaay younger than her I. 
																	Note that the horse must begin the canter stride with his outside hind leg so that he finishes up on the correct lead. 
																	After warming your horse up put him on a large circle at a walk. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Your left leg is on the girth asking the horse to pick up the canter. 
																	Ive had my horse Poet for almost 2 years now. 
																	Your right leg should be slightly behind the girth asking the horses right hind leg to strike off into left canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Weve been having trouble picking up the correct lead going to the right for quite a while now. 
																	This video explains how to teach your horse to pick up the correct lead every time How to get hip control on your ho. 
																	As you look in the direction you want to go lift your inside rein several inches directly up. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A roll back to the outside brings the horse in a position to shift the weigh. 
																	It was because of other reasons. 
																	Now were with a different trainer. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Weve been through a couple different trainers but not because they couldnt get the right lead. 
																	I dont have time here to show you how to fix the problem but I do show you a common mi. 
																	For instance to go from walk to right-lead canter time your leg aid so that you signal your horse the moment that he lifts his right front leg. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This slight bend to the inside of the circle is preparation for the right lead canter. 
																	Returning to the trot and asking for the canter again usually remedies the situation right away. 
																	Another exercise to help your horse learn the right lead is to practice the leg yield on a clockwise circle.

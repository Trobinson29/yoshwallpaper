	<h1>How Much Land Is Needed To Keep A Horse</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">To own a horse at least an acre of land is needed for every horse that is kept but more land is necessary if grass is a staple in the animals diet. So in the ordinary stall size 3 4 m usually holds 2-3 miniature horses depending on their caliber. If your soil is rocky dry or swampy the acreage isnt going to matter because there wont be good pasture but your horses will still need plenty of room to move. <br>

																	<strong>How much land is needed to keep a horse</strong>. 
								
																	The minimum area needed to house a horse for turnout is 01 one-tenth of an acre approximately 4500 square feet or 75 feet x 60 feet for an exercise lot. 
																	Minimum grazing recommendation for a full-sized horse is about 1 12 acre per animal. 
																	According to Washington State Universitys Managing Small-Acreage Horse Farms the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse although a larger space would be more desirable. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Day yards or holding yards should be at least 3 m wide and be an area of at least 20 square metres. 
																	Like keep him in one pasture1 acre for about 3 weeks to 4 and then put him in the other pasture for that mush time and so on and so on. 
																	Alaska California Maryland Nevada New York and Pennsylvania. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	12-24 acres depending on the stock in the paddock. 
																	In addition to the amount of land you also need to check for proper zoning requirements. 
																	Obviously many people keep horses on smaller amounts of land and do not depend on the land to provide any forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you keep a horse on your own property be sure to post any warning signs that are required in your state to help keep you from being liable should your horse injure someone. 
																	Even without the laws the recommended pasture acreage to support one horse is 25 acres. 
																	Youd need to manage and treat the area to maintain a constant supply of feed throughout the year as well. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If they have less the pasture gets overgrazed and the horse would need additional hay - or even hay year round which gets expensive. 
																	In smaller turnout pens its critical to remove manure frequently to avoid a buildup which can attract flies or produce an odor. 
																	For working horses yard size should be increased to 35 square metres. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Where a roof or canopy is provided it should be high enough to avoid injuring a rider or fractious horse. 
																	A ranch or small farm in the southwest may only provide a 20 x 40 run for a horse yet those horses remain as healthy as horses running in a 40-acre field Yoder said. 
																	For physical well-being horses do not require room to run only move around freely for at least a portion of every day.

																	<strong>How to teach a horse to pick up its back feet</strong>. 
								
																	If your horse still does not shift his weight or pick up his foot gently rock your shoulder into his upper leg rocking on and off. 
																	The chestnut on the forelegs and the hocks on the hind legs. 
																	Its not for protection as i also know some people dont wear boots so the horse hits the pole - feels it and doesnt like it so wont drop legs. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When your horse lifts his foot hold and support the fetlock and hoof with both hands. 
																	Process is quite simple just press the button until the horse lifts the foot. 
																	Take half a broomstick put a sleeve over it stuff it with straw and put a glove on the end he says. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I dont do this with my mare but ive been told that if your horse is being lazy and wont pick feet up put some weighted boots on or make the boots tighter. 
																	Marlis Amato demonstrates how to eliminate heaviness leaning and resistance to having a foot off the ground whether for routine hoof care or for the farr. 
																	Dont ask the horse to hold the foot up for long at first. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The purpose of this exercise is to teach your horse to lift its feet when you press a specific location a button on its legs. 
																	However it never hurts to check the horses opposite legs and hooves for heat. 
																	How to Tell if the Horse is in Pain if your horse is refusing to pick up its feet due to pain be aware that the pain point can be found anywhere throughout the horses body. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Start by gently squeezing the cap of the hock then increase the pressure by squeezing harder and harder. 
																	When your horse picks his foot up have your helper praise him effusively with pats a soothing voice or a treat. 
																	Make sure that you are suitable clothed and working in a safe area. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground. 
																	Learn to relax and enjoy your horse. 
																	Michelle Quirico MQ Training is based out of the North Bay at American Canyon Training Center in Napa CA.

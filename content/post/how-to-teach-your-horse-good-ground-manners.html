						<h3 class="h5"><b>Ground manners is about teaching your horse how to behave around humans and that you are his protector and friend.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach your horse good ground manners</strong>. 
								
																	Kind of where the gold star is on this appaloosa gelding. 
																	These essentials include 1 how to stand tied up 2 how to move away from pressure 3 how to give to a bit or side-pull and 4 overall basic ground manners ie. 
																	This includes showing your horse that mugging and pushy behavior doesnt get treats but standing still with their nose away from you does. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A good long-term relationship between you and your horse is built from the ground up literally. 
																	Pet the horse when he stops. 
																	Yielding hindquarters in its most basic state is just your horse moving his hind end away from you with a physical cue on his side. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horse training success is all in the work from the ground. 
																	When you ask your horse to back up or step to the side they should move away from your pressure and not resist it. 
																	You just need to do some treat training to show your horse how you would like them to behave around food. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The answer to each of these questions is in your horses ground manners in other words how much your horse pays attention to you and respects your space on the ground while leading tacking up or just standing next to you. 
																	I never go out to specifically teach my horse ground manners they learn just by day to day handling - done correctly. 
																	The handler should be at the horses shoulder with the horses head and neck beyond them. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Teach Your Horse to Yield Hindquarters. 
																	When you lead your horse they should walk beside you quietly whilst paying attention to you. 
																	Thankfully it is easy to teach your horse to have perfect manners around treats. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Learning horse training tips to establish good ground manners can make all the difference in having a well-behaved horse and one that may be a problemA common complaint among horse owners is the lack of ground manners and without them it can detract from the pleasure of horse ownership. 
																	Do not allow the horse to walk forward until you tell him to do so. 
																	Walk Quietly A horse should walk beside you calmly while paying attention to you at all times.

					<p align="justify">Away from home find a level area near the trailers or the facilitys barn area. The length of warm-up depends on your individual horse. The worst possible place to begin training a horse on the trail would be on a narrow path where you have no room to move the horses feet and you have to cross obstacles you havent introduced to your horse such as a suspended bridge water steep hills logs so high that he has to jump over them etc. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach a horse to trail ride</strong>. 
								
																	Go where you point him. 
																	That is your job. 
																	Stand on the left side of your horse and cue him to lower his head. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Western riders usually use one hand while English riders use two Sit deep and relaxed in the saddle and keep the reins slightly loose. 
																	The chain is meant to give a subtle light signal. 
																	Avoid teaching the sidepass to the right until your mare sidepasses well to the left Slide your right hand down the right rein and slowly tip her nose to the right. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Begin by teaching a sidepass to the left. 
																	Instead practice the skill by riding a route with several different water crossings in a short distance or when you have but one practice area ride up and down in the water for a bit or let the horse stand and play. 
																	In other words just have a little fun then move on down the trail. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	So youll need to practice the speed control cues of speed up slow down turn left turn right stop and back up with your horse at home to a much greater degree than you could expect him to deal with on the trail. 
																	Absolute and quick obedience -- 100 compliance without an argument should be the goal. 
																	The less experience you have the easier your training project should be. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pick a horse that matches your CURRENT ability level. 
																	You dont want to pull back on your horses mouth as you ask them to move forward. 
																	A good trail horse is nothing more than a horse that does everything right away that a rider asks. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	At home warm up your horse in an arena with good footing. 
																	A good trail horse will go willingly over obstacles around rocks down canyons and especially through water. 
																	At this point you dont need to make him walk directly up to it--you just need to make him walk by it so he can realize its not a monster out to get him and that he can put his trust in you.

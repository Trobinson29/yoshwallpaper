	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Stand at your horses shoulder facing the hindquarters and lean down as though youre going to pick up your horses foot. They should be set about 32 metres apart with the outer sides as high as you can make them while remaining comfortable about the height. Favourite answer grids are a good way to get horses to pick up their feet. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>If the horse ignores you increase the pressure by squeezing the chestnut.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to get your horse to pick up his feet when jumping</strong>. 
								
																	Once your horse has a feel for going over a jump and knows where to put his feet take away the trotting poles and set up five or six individual jumps around the arena. 
																	You want to give your horse plenty space on either side so hold the whip about 3-4 feet away from the horses shoulder. 
																	If he rushes to the next obstacle halt him after each jump until he learns to not speed off. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Continue holding the chestnut even getting a pretty good grip on it until your horse makes the slightest try at picking up that foot. 
																	Hesitate just a moment so that your horse notices that youve stopped rubbing. 
																	I would also leave ground poles along the sides of the arena so he always has incentive and focus to. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Tuck those knees up. 
																	Put your hand on the chestnut then snap your fingers or whistle or whatever signal youd like to teach your horse and lightly grasp the chestnut. 
																	The amount of head movement during this phase varies considerably among horses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Marlis Amato demonstrates how to eliminate heaviness leaning and resistance to having a foot off the ground whether for routine hoof care or for the farr. 
																	Put a bounce rail 8 to 9 feetdepending on his natural stridein front of a 2-foot-high vertical or smaller if youre a less experienced rider. 
																	After the bounces set up a vertical one stride away from the bounces followed by an oxer two strides after the vertical. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Place a ground rail several inches in front of the jump. 
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground. 
																	Ive never had to do this with Bronson as he is so careful but my yard owners done this sort of thing with a couple of youngsters On the pic it looks like your horse is just a little muddled at the bigger fence might be nerves. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pinch or twist your horses chestnut just enough to make him notice and lift his foot in response. 
																	I would suggest groundpoles as well and if you can get him to move more freelyjust concentrate on an openworking trot for a good portion of your workout verses a collected oneget him really moving his feet that way he really has to pick them up. 
																	This will teach your horse to keep going at a controlled pace after each jump.

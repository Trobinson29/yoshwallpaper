													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to train a horse flying changes</strong>. 
								
																	After ten minutes or so he should be quietly performing both longitudinal and lateral movements without resisting your leg or rein contact. 
																	Lengthen and shorten a bit asking with your legs for a slightly faster trot then with a light rein contact for a working trot. 
																	The fewer you do at this point the better off your horse will be. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Give him a breather. 
																	Overdrilling flying changes can make horses nervous and tensewhich lead to many problems. 
																	If you achieve a good flying change softly come back to a walk pat your horse and yourself and repeat the exercise in the other direction. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You dont want the horse to anticipate changing leads from the change of bend. 
																	It doesnt matter which discipline you ride in training a horse to perform a flying lead change is essential as you move up the levels of the sport. 
																	Before you ask for a flying change the canter must be collected and horse must be able to sit with lowered quarters and you must be able to sit deep and still in the saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A special little-known way to get your horse to do flying lead changes in 30 minutes or less. 
																	It gets the horse really listening to the leg aids. 
																	To do a flying lead change bring your horse to a collected canter and ride in a figure-eight shape in the arena. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Youll see how to correct those mistakes in real world training. 
																	Brad Barkemeyer explains the importance of having consistent signals when asking for a lead change and demonstrates how to properly guide your horse through the maneuver. 
																	When training jumping horses to do flying changes raised poles are a good way of encouraging the horse to land on the correct leg or to change as required by the rider. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The leg aids should not be too obvious but the outside leg is used stronger than the inside. 
																	A great exercise for a horse that likes to anticipate the flying change is to practice slight changes of bend at the counter canter. 
																	Then apply pressure with your right leg and release the tension on the left rein.

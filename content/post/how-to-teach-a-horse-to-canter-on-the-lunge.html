																	<strong>How to teach a horse to canter on the lunge</strong>. 
								
																	To teach your horse to lunge stand in the circle with the lunge line stacked into a folded line. 
																	I want to share the top 10 techniques have been working to convince speed-racer to move from trot-canter on the line to a calm walk. 
																	Hop off work on some canter on the lunge and look for a riding school horse with a balanced canter to help you learn. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	At its furthest point back encourage with your voice by clucking a bit as it comes forward increasing the pace of your voiceyou want to go from the two beat trot into the three beat canter cluck. 
																	The working area is too small for the horse to canter. 
																	Spend most time at the trot and just canter briefly until your horse gains strength and balance. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Cantering on the lunge is hard work. 
																	Change direction frequently at least every 5 minutes. 
																	Get him to canter and if he stops just keep asking him to canter again until he has gone one lap around. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Before introducing the canter the horse should be taught to go forward on the circle on the lunge line in both directions at walk and trot giving to the contact of the side reins and accepting the presence of the lunge whip as a driving aid. 
																	Its a great tool t. 
																	First we get the trot correct and get him stretching into the contact before we move to the canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pick an associative word for the walk. 
																	If you do not use the same words with the same inflection your horse will become confused. 
																	Put your horse into a small lunge circle with just the distance of the whips shaft between you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Remember the first thing we must insist on in the lunge is that the horse move out and away from us. 
																	Increase the timedistance you have him go gradually but dont give in he needs to learn. 
																	Eventually they will or should anyway break into a canter.

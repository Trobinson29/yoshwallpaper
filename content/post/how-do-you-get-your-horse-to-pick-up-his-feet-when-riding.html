						<h3 class="h5"><b>Pick up a leg when hes straddled out and he could lose his balance as well as his hoof-handling confidence.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How do you get your horse to pick up his feet when riding</strong>. 
								
																	Prepare you horse in advance. 
																	Its a reward and a way for him to slow down his legs. 
																	A horses respect is earned by moving his feet forward backward left and right and always rewarding the slightest try. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pay attention to any signs of trouble through the whole process. 
																	Run your hand down the horses leg and tap it at the back of the leg so it will lift its foot. 
																	If the horse picks the foot up but then leans it on you let go for a second without dropping it or drop the foot completely if the horse is really rude and then support again. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As soon as the horse responds by taking his weight off his leg immediately release the pressure and rub his leg. 
																	Spend time teaching your horse to pick up his feet and stand still while his feet are being handled. 
																	As you pick up his feet set him up for success by making sure his weight is evenly distributed over all of his legs. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Be there to hold the horse. 
																	To pick a horses hoof wait until the horse is calm the stand next to one of the horses front shoulders. 
																	As he goes over the bounce rail close your legs on his sides as if you were asking for a canter depart. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When horses are thrown together out in a pasture its natural for them to establish a pecking order. 
																	The slightest signs of tension can show up with a skin twitch fidgeting irritation or general resistance. 
																	It will take time for your horse to get accustomed to having one leg in the air so be happy at first with just a few seconds. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This will set him up for a good takeoff over the jump. 
																	Think about respect from your horses point of view. 
																	Make sure he gets in the right state of mind before you go to handle his legs. 
															</p>

					<p align="justify">Get up early around 6am to feed and check the horses before deciding on each horses exercise regime for the day. For a person to qualify for the position of horse trainer they need to have prior experience working with and riding horses. Many times trainers will push riders and horses out of their comfort zones which can be a good thing but if the rider and horse is not ready it will be disastrous. <br>

																	<strong>How to be a good racehorse trainer</strong>. 
								
																	Bad breaks and good ones faith slumps hunches and especially luck are the ultimate rulers in this sport so it takes the right trainer to make the experience tolerable. 
																	The money you spend as an owner of racehorses is money you must be prepared to kiss good-bye. 
																	We are going to do this with a game. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In this game we will decide what goodcharacteristics a trainer should have and the poorcharacteristics a trainer shouldnt. 
																	Horse training is something that you cannot learn overnight. 
																	Now the real work begins. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Overseeing the fitness work of each horse on the gallops. 
																	As a trainer you will use your voice a lot as well as engage in a good amount of physical contact. 
																	There is a strong need for a trainer to develop networking skills. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Lets take a look at the quali-ties a good trainer should have and also the ones that are not so desirable. 
																	This guide will focus on some of the very best trainers over both jumps and the flat past and present internationally and in Great Britain and Ireland. 
																	Do take note that a trainer doesnt only work with learners. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Great trainers have competed at multiple levels ridden a wide variety of horses and studied. 
																	In addition to knowledge a great trainer will have a wealth of experience. 
																	Many trainers will give the horses treats and other forms of positive reinforcement. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	An understanding of revenue cost margins ROI return on investment and staffing would definitely give a trainer better insight on how his or her role affects the organization. 
																	This includes professional riding experience former training or an educational background in veterinary care. 
																	Training your racehorse can be fun but it can be a big challenge for a beginner.

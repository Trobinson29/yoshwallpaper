													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How often to feed horses in winter</strong>. 
								
																	One method for changing the type of feed is to replace 25 percent of the current food with the new food every two days so that in six days the horse is eating l00 percent of the new food. 
																	Horses should be fed a minimum of twice a day. 
																	In general feeding an additional one-quarter pound of grain per 100 pounds of body weight daily to non-working horses can provide adequate calories during cold windy and wet weather. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Most importantly the ice that covers the watering trough or water bucket. 
																	Most horse owners enjoy feeding their horses. 
																	If you do feed a concentrate ration to your horse avoid straight cereal grains like oats corn or barley and make sure each feeding is accompanied by as much forage as possible. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Feed horses according to their work schedule. 
																	Most 1000-pound adult horses need at least 10 to 12 gallons of water daily. 
																	The goal should always be to maximize the amount your horse drinks to help prevent dehydration and colic. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To ease the transition into winter deworm your horses based on fecal analysis and make sure they are in good body condition. 
																	Its fun to see your horse enjoy its meals and come running to you when it sees you with the feed bucket. 
																	Even in areas not affected by snow cover grass often stops growing and the nutritional quality may decrease. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As pasture quality or accessibility declines consider increasing hay and concentratesThat way your horse wont lose weight during the winter or lack important nutrition. 
																	Water for the horse during cold weather is too often overlooked. 
																	Ideally the water temperature should be at 50-65 F to encourage drinking. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Measure feed accurately and feed consistently. 
																	It could be in the form of long stem hay chopped hays forage based cubes or combinations thereof. 
																	A minimum of 70 percent of a horses daily calories should come from hay or pasture.

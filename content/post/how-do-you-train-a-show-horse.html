																	<strong>How do you train a show horse</strong>. 
								
																	Break your training goals down into manageable sections and write down the smaller milestones and time frame when you can reach them. 
																	The fifth thing to do when you want to learn how to train a horse is to keep a good written training plan and follow it. 
																	This may be because the roots of the word in reference to horses comes from the military riding schools of Europe such as the Spanish Riding School in Vienna Austria. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses respond well to verbal cues. 
																	Start training your horse as soon as possible - Its important for your horse to trust you and by building a positive relationship immediately after you meet the horse this will become possible. 
																	After a few moments the horse will buck and your character will be thrown from the horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Bear in mind the horses stride pattern and quirks and plan your course based on that information. 
																	Theyll start by walking in and out of the gates build up to standing for periods of time in the space both by themselves and beside other horses and finally learn to exit the stall at a run. 
																	Your character must not be holding any items such as tools weapons or food in its hands when taming a horseStep 3 Right-click directly on the horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its also fun to teach your horse unique tricks and even non-horse people enjoy watching horses perform them. 
																	You can immediately hop off the horses back get on your own horse and ride back much faster. 
																	Two simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Most horses natural tendency is to turn to the left best but a few turn better to the right. 
																	Youll get a feel for which way he turns best. 
																	Make a clucking noise with your mouth as a signal that you want your horse to move forward. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When preparing for the show you need to trim your mini horses mane and tail. 
																	The tamed horse will follow you all the way there. 
																	Your character will mount the horse and the horse will allow you to ride him for a brief period of time.

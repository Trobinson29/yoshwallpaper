	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">If your horse will be working to the left hold the lunge line in your left hand and your lunge whip in your right. As soon as the horse turns away from you or stops paying attention to you shuffle and stamp your feet to spook her - so she looks at you. Using varying heights of cavalletti set around the circle you can lunge your horse on the circle and over the small jumps. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach a young horse to lunge</strong>. 
								
																	When she looks at you immediately go back to your original unassuming. 
																	Turn them loose and then you just stand in the middle of the pen in a very unassuming non-threatening way and just look off into the distance and watch the horse out of the corner of your eye. 
																	Ask for the canter by raising the whip again clucking and saying canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A properly fitted halter is beneficial with a lunge line of up to 30 feet commonly being used. 
																	Hold the line firmly in one hand without wrapping it around your wrist so you can let additional line out as needed. 
																	Lungeing your horse is a great way to build muscle exercise your horse check for lameness or to see what kind of mood your horse is in. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Basic instruction to teach your horse to lunge. 
																	Jennies masterclass had a particular focus on training and exercising young horses on the lunge but the legendary rider and trainers advice and tips can be applied to horses of any age. 
																	With my previous young horse I used the method of starting of a short rein and going in small circles and gradually letting her out. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The rein itself takes some handling and you will need to be shown how to do this and practise on a gate post gathering the rein and looping it. 
																	To properly lunge a horse youll need to have protection for the horses legs. 
																	I planned to lunge her in a halter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Next stand at the horses side facing its shoulder and hold the lead 2-4 inches from the snap. 
																	The horse will need to wear boots all round a saddle or roller side reins a lunge cavesson and a lunge rein which is of the correct length and weight. 
																	What i would do with this horse is put her in the pen with no lead rope or lunge line. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Hold the Lunge Line and Whip. 
																	Well maybe you should use a chain lead rope and put it over his nose to give you more control. 
																	Before teaching a horse to lunge there must be some basic ground manners present.

	<h1>When To Start Halter Breaking A Foal</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">In fact you should begin the process as early as possible according to Pattie Haney breeding manager for Matthews Cutting Horses in Turkey North Carolina. Here foals have a halter on early generally within the first couple of days Actual halter breaking at a few weeks old along side the dam with a butt rope. My system eliminates such risk and keeps it simply. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Because we understand what motivates different behaviors in horses so much better than we once did much of the brute force of traditional horse training equipment has gone out of training.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>When to start halter breaking a foal</strong>. 
								
																	He tries to retreat away from the foal before the foal retreats away from Clay to help the baby build confidence. 
																	You dont want to underwork or overwork them Clinton warns and recommends working with foals 15 to 20 minutes once or twice a day and giving them short frequent breaks throughout the session. 
																	It all depends on the personality and needs of each foal. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horse training and the horse training equipment used for horse training has changed dramatically over the last 20-30 years. 
																	They might start a foal at 30 days old or they might wait longer. 
																	Foals often scratch their ears and face with a back hoof and a hoof can get caught in the halter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I usually break in my foals to halter when they are 3-4months old. 
																	If she lets you pet her all over I would start working with objects. 
																	Tom and Margo say their halter breaking program might take one day or three weeks and they might spend more time on different steps with different foals. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This is a problem because it means the horse has learned nothing and we probably arent reading the body language correctly. 
																	Before this i spend as much time as possible with the foal and i let them smell the leadrope and halter to get them used to the. 
																	Once the foal starts to feel soft and responsive to the added pressure of the lead rope consistently then Clay will start to rub the foal on its neck and all across its body. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Foals can stick their heads through gaps in fencing or stall walls that a larger horse wouldnt catching the halter and becoming entangled. 
																	Moderation is the key when it comes to training foals. 
																	It took us a few days before we got a halter on Eve and we made it a point to take it off after every sessions so she had to be re-caught. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A foal should learn to walk quietly beside the handler. 
																	If the youngster pulls back ease the rope a little bit until the foal learns to yield to the pressure of being tied. 
																	They face enough danger of severe injury as it is without a foal that is not halter broken to start with adding the scoot past the owner because of the rope with the marked increased in risk of pulling the foal over onto the back of its head.

					<p align="justify">Most people think they know what a neck rein is but they are actually wrong. Your hand will be centered a few inches in front of your body. To do this move your hand slightly in order to place the indirect rein against your horses neck as you apply pressure with your outside leg in position one. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Informative video shows the correct and incorrect way to neck rein a western horse one handed.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to ride a horse neck reining</strong>. 
								
																	Traditionally Western riders hold the reins in their non-dominant hand leaving their dominant most often right hand free to do work like handle a rope or open a gate. 
																	At the same time tip your hand slightly to apply light direct-rein pressure even as your indirect rein comes against your horses neck. 
																	To turn right move your hand to the right which will lay the left rein against your horses neck and if he doesnt turn use the fingers on your right hand put a little bit of pressure on the right rein to help him make the turn. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Neck reining uses a loose indirect rein across the horses neck to encourage the horse to move away from the pressure. 
																	This rein length will allow you to cross the reins over your horses neck so that you can hold both reins with one hand in the center. 
																	You can now move away from the squares. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Neck reining is a way to steer your horse by laying the rein against the side of your horses neck. 
																	By the time your horse is six he must be ridden with one hand and a curb bit at the breed shows. 
																	However if the horses neck bends to the outside and that rein becomes loose youll know that the horse is not truly connected. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Think about your hands guiding your horses shoulders and neck and always keep them straight. 
																	If youre on a horse that knows how to neck rein they should move to the left. 
																	If you would like to know the right way to rein your horse follow along with this video and soon youll be horseback riding like a pro. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In order neck rein and do this youd lay your right rein lightly against your horses neck and add leg pressure with your right leg signaling the horse to move. 
																	If you want to turn your horse left you would lay the right rein against the horses neck. 
																	If the horses neck remains straight you know that your connecting aids were effective and the horse is in your outside rein. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Like every child graduates from elementary to high school neck reining is the next step in a Western horses education. 
																	For the uninitiated neck reining is the cue that tells the horse which way to turn. 
																	This way of steering your horse will free up one hand to swing a polo mallet open a gate or throw a lasso.

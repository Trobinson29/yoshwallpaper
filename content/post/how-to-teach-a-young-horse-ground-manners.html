																	Emilie Bettez A year ago. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you are in a negative state of mind dont even think of going near the pen. 
																	Decide how far behind you your horse should be and walk to that distance ahead of him while he stands. 
																	You have to be the dominant in your relationship if you want her to respect you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As you release his hoof gently guide it to the ground teaching him patience and that his hooves are handled on human terms not his. 
																	There are a few fundamentals you can teach a horse no matter what your training style that will help make those first few rides go as smoothly as possible. 
																	How do I teach a great riding horse thoroughbred better ground manners. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I just hired a trainer to work with him for a month on ground manners. 
																	Instilling proper manners is important in equine training. 
																	These essentials include 1 how to stand tied up 2 how to move away from pressure 3 how to give to a bit or side-pull and 4 overall basic ground manners ie. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once your yearling is comfortable having his feet picked up practice gently banging on them with the handle of a hoof pick to simulate having shoes nailed on. 
																	Kind of where the gold star is on this appaloosa gelding. 
																	My mare is very rude and pushy and never listens to me I need some advice Follow Share on facebook Post. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	What are some exercises you do with your horse to teach good ground manners.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Lunging should ideally always be done in an enclosed area so that if the horse should break free he can be quickly and easily recovered.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How often should i lunge my horse</strong>. 
								
																	How long should I lunge a horse for. 
																	Let the horse walk around the circle about 3-4 times. 
																	Why do you lunge a horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Punishing a horse is never a good idea and will only lead to a horse that acts out. 
																	To give your horse clear aids and direct him your lunge line and whip should form a triangle. 
																	As well as a loosener before riding lunging is helpful in developing balance rhythm and to improve the horses gaits. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	4 Move to a trot for about 15 minutes. 
																	No you dont have to lunge every horse before you ride. 
																	Spend most time at the trot and just canter briefly until your horse gains strength and balance. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Think about the frequency of lunging too as a horse shouldnt need to be lunged 4-5 times every week on a regular basis. 
																	If the circle is smaller like 15 meters then 15 minutes on each rein will work. 
																	Instead you want to develop a bond with your horse and. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	And because its winter so he needs some more warm up time. 
																	Lunging is very basically a technique for training horses. 
																	If the circle is 20 meters then you could lunge the horse for about 20 minutes on each rein. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You shouldnt lunge five times a week or for longer than 20-30 minutes depending on your horse and their current fitness level but done correctly lunging once or twice a week can be a very useful tool in developing fitness. 
																	If the horse seems comfortable in loose side reinshalt and adjust them a little tighter one hole at a time. 
																	Dont stand in the same spot for lungeing.

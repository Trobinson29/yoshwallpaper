	<h1>What To Do When You Get Bit By A Horse</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Horse owners especially those in regions populated by poisonous snakes should have a plan and some sort of emergency preparedness kit before setting out on a trail. Horses are associative thinkers. If there is significant trauma or if the bite is over a joint hand foot or a prosthetic device you should see a doctor immediately because antibiotics are most likely indicated. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Wear protective footwear and clothing so if the horse bites your arm he will get a mouthful of clothing rather than you.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>What to do when you get bit by a horse</strong>. 
								
																	In most cases a horse fly bite can heal on. 
																	Ask for second opinions do your own research and. 
																	A bit that is too low or too high will cause discomfort and you want to encourage your horse to hold the bit quietly. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you have been bitten by an animal or another person. 
																	Outfit your horse in a snaffle bit. 
																	Allow at least three or four sessions of working on this exercise ideally on consecutive days to give your horse enough time to get it. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Do not encourage playful behaviours eg. 
																	You want him to associate his effort to bite with a distracting tap on his shin. 
																	The biting habit can start when the horse is quite young. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	An experienced helper or a friend with a good pair of eyes is another help since a lot of on the bit is the horses silhouette and frame. 
																	Consulting your vet and chiropractor is a good start but you may need to dig deeper to discover the root of the bit chewing problem. 
																	Do groundwork first to get your horse relaxed and using the thinking side of his brain. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Wear a helmet so if the horse bites it doesnt injure your head. 
																	A cold frosty bit is not a nice experience even for a well-trained horse. 
																	The first and sometimes the only way most people deal with this problem is to slap punch andor yell at the horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Clean the wound immediately by running warm tap water over it for a couple of minutes its a good idea to do this even if the skin does not appear to be broken. 
																	Nipping that could lead to bites. 
																	Pay attention to what you are doing around horses to reduce the risk of being bitten.

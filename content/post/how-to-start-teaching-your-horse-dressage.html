					<p align="justify">You can do this by reriding your test and throwing in a figure eight to each trot circle before continuing on to the next movement. Simple transitions walk-halt halt-walk to teach the horse to react to the leg seat and rein aids promptly. From that trot you then use half-halts to shorten and shorten the trot until you have passage. <br>

																	<strong>How to start teaching your horse dressage</strong>. 
								
																	When Im teaching my students I often refer to the different gears you need to be able to access when youre riding. 
																	Step 1 In the arena ride down the long side. 
																	Hopefully this beginners guide will help you to get started. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If there is no wall the outside aids have to keep the horse on the curvature of the turn and not allow him to fall out. 
																	Use your hips to turn the horse. 
																	When teaching any horse the object is to have the horse respond to our aids. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Dressage is an incredibly rewarding equestrian sport that will also be tonnes of fun for you and your horse. 
																	When you begin to teach your horse passage you must have a swinging collected trot. 
																	Its also important that your horse is relaxed and happily accepts an elastic contact. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Only when the horses outside shoulder reaches the marker should the rider start the turn across the diagonal. 
																	Encourage your horse and yourself to keep the quality of the canter by using appropriate exercises. 
																	Teach him that when the work becomes a little harder he must keep his activity and alignment. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its important that the halt is square. 
																	When you want your horse to turn pull your waist up a bit in the saddle every time. 
																	A clear dressage training plan for your horse is essential if you are to progress up the levels. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Just before you reach the corner ride a half-halt to rebalance the horses weight back onto his hindquarters and shorten your reins slightly to gather your horse into a secure connection. 
																	Stop go left right back and so on. 
																	At Horse Country we offer a huge range of equestrian training and learning tutorials from top riders.

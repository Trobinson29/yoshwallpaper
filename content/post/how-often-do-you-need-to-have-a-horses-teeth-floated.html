	<h1>How Often Do You Need To Have A Horses Teeth Floated</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Many old horses have gaps made by teeth that have fallen out making it very difficult for them to chew. If the dentist you choose to work on your horses mouth is too aggressive the dental floats will loosen the teeth. Think about that when youre talking to folks that tell you that your horse needs to have his teeth floated twice a year. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>How often should you float your horses teeth.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How often do you need to have a horses teeth floated</strong>. 
								
																	The teeth dont sit flat on each otherthe upper teeth hang over on the cheek side of the lower teeth and the lower teeth arent in contact with the tongue side of the upper teeth and theyre at a bit of an angle. 
																	My twenty five year old mare is done every year. 
																	Young horses teeth grow change more quickly so 6 monthly may be advisable until around 6yo or soa good dentist will give you an honest answer and working horses that wear a bit or horses that are fed hard feed may also need their teeth done more frequently than yearly. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Floating is the practice of filing off any sharp edges or hooks that may form on the edges of the teeth. 
																	A horses teeth erupt or grow approximately 2-3 mm about the width of a Q-Tip a year well into the horses 20s to replace the tooth length that wears away while he eats. 
																	How often should I have my horses teeth floated. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It is important however not to over-float your horses teeth. 
																	Everyone else over three years old has been fine with every 2-3 even 4 years in all honesty. 
																	So we do have to float but let your veterinarian who is examining the mouth at least once a year tell you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When the teeth fall out it makes it difficult for the horse to chew his food thus shortening his life. 
																	Older horses may only need their teeth floated once every 2-3 years. 
																	I watch for dropping feed I will grind their jaw back and fourth to listen for anything out of the norm. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	So domesticated contained or confined horses theyre not grazing on gritty grass all the time and they dont wear their teeth down like a horse living out and grazing all day would. 
																	My horses do not give me much reason to think they need their teeth done when it is time. 
																	Horse owners are typically knowledgable in primary horse care such as feeding and shoeing but floating teeth are a critical aspect of your horse health as well. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Everything from I never float my horses teeth to it needs to be done for optimum performance and health to every 6 months for horses less than 5 years of age and over 17 So what is it. 
																	A horses teeth should be checked annually by a veterinarian during their annual exam. 
																	Daugherty horses under the age of 5 should be floated every 6 months because there are many changes going on in the horses mouth during this period.

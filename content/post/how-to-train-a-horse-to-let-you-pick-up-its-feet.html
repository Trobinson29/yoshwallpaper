													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to train a horse to let you pick up its feet</strong>. 
								
																	Make sure he gets in the right state of mind before you go to handle his legs. 
																	When your horse picks his foot up have your helper praise him effusively with pats a soothing voice or a treat. 
																	Teaching a horse to pick up its feet can be a frustrating job. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Butte Creek Ranch boss Scott DePaolo explains how to get your horse to lift its feet for you so you can use a hoof pick to clean rocks out of its hoof. 
																	Once the horse has lifted up his foot ask your helper to praise him effusively by for instance using pats on the back a soothing voice or a treat. 
																	Then put the foot down gently and repeat. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	On the back legs the cue for the horse to pick up his foot is to lightly squeeze the cap of his hock. 
																	The horse gets frustrated because he doesnt know what the trainer is asking and the trainer often goes too fast too soon. 
																	If your horse still does not shift his weight or pick up his foot gently rock your shoulder into his upper leg rocking on and off. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This can get dangerous when working with back feet because an irriated frustrated horse is more likely to take a kick at the trainer. 
																	Repeat several times if necessary. 
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You could also enhance this further by softly pinching the lower tendon running along the back of the leg. 
																	Once you feel him leaning away from your body pick up his leg. 
																	When your horse lifts his foot hold and support the fetlock and hoof with both hands. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Gradually increase the amount of time you ask the horse to hold its foot in the air. 
																	Michelle Quirico MQ Training is based out of the North Bay at American Canyon Training Center in Napa CA. 
																	Do not attempt to lift his leg up.

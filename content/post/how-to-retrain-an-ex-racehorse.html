					<p align="justify">Bianca Souter is a young rider from Victoria who competed at 1 level with her horse Sebastian. Having a rider climb up the block is another potential source of anxiety for an ex-racehorse so be sure to treat the mounting experience as a training opportunity in itself. As youre training your ex-racehorse avoid getting into a 2-point or leaning forward particularly at the canter until the horse is well-trained. <br>

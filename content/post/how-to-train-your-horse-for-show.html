																	<strong>How to train your horse for show</strong>. 
								
																	Introduce your horse to the arena and walk it around before the show. 
																	The fifth thing to do when you want to learn how to train a horse is to keep a good written training plan and follow it. 
																	Start training your horse as soon as possible - Its important for your horse to trust you and by building a positive relationship immediately after you meet the horse this will become possible. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A correctly structured yearly training plan induces physiological adaptation and allows a horse to peak for important competitions. 
																	Keep the pressure consistent until he make a forward movement. 
																	Your horse should anchor his right hind foot in one spot and pivot around that foot by stepping his left front leg in front of and across his right front leg. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Let them meet other horses and riders. 
																	If your horse tends to be a bit mouthy and nips teaching a horse to give a kiss upon the cheek might not be safe so find an alternative that keeps the kisses away from the handlers face. 
																	Back up by just pointing at your horses nose or chest. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	By Jess Hallas-Kilcoyne - Its that time of year againtime to start thinking about ways to improve your turnout for competition in the coming show season. 
																	Below I go through some helpful tips on creating a yearly training program so that you can maximize your horses. 
																	For instance if the horse you are training has never worn a bridle it would be a good smaller goal to introduce and have him be comfortable with things like. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Break your training goals down into manageable sections and write down the smaller milestones and time frame when you can reach them. 
																	After youve arrived and unpacked take your horse out of the stable and walk them around. 
																	Keep the volume and length of the cluck consistent throughout training so that your horse doesnt get confused. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Jul 26 2016 - No matter what level you are competing at 4-H weekend breed shows or the AQHA World Championship Show success in showmanship comes down to three things. 
																	Make a clucking noise with your mouth as a signal that you want your horse to move forward. 
																	Depending on your experience level you may need to work with a professional to begin training your horse but first get tips and advice on common horse behaviors and basic training techniques.

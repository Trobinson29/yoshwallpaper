						<h3 class="h5"><b>Find yourself a dressage instructor and start riding through patterns learning how to help your horse balance and understanding how to find the rhythm in your horses gaits.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach your horse dressage</strong>. 
								
																	Teach him that when the work becomes a little harder he must keep his activity and alignment. 
																	As soon as you are done riding your USDF Introductory Level Test C walk on a long rein and spend this time allowing your horse to catch his breath and thinking about how you felt about your first working set. 
																	To teach your horse to lengthen begin with an active rhythmic working trot. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Use your hips to turn the horse. 
																	Keeping your upper body balanced squeeze your legs in rhythm with hour horses stride thinking of pushing him forward into the bridle. 
																	When you want your horse to turn pull your waist up a bit in the saddle every time. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Place one hand on the horses poll directly behind the ears. 
																	Turn your horse on a large circle using your legs to maintain the same marching tempo. 
																	Apply gentle pressure to both the rope and the poll to ask the horse to lower his head. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Your instructor can help you learn new maneuvers and also help teach your horse to respond correctly to certain cues. 
																	Push straight with your hips in the direction that you want to go. 
																	Encourage your horse and yourself to keep the quality of the canter by using appropriate exercises. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The best way to impress a dressage judge is to put in the work at home train your horse correctly along the dressage Scales of Training and then demonstrate that. 
																	As you use your legs squeeze both hands on the reins then immediately relax your hands but dont drop contact. 
																	When Im teaching my students I often refer to the different gears you need to be able to access when youre riding. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When teaching any horse the object is to have the horse respond to our aids. 
																	As the horses level of training increases he learns to listen to your seat and hands and channels the forward running energy into more engagement and brilliance. 
																	Start by desensitizing the horse to pressure on his head.

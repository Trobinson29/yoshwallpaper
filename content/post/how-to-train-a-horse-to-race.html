																	<strong>How to train a horse to race</strong>. 
								
																	The two-horse system works great for this training. 
																	Others need time to acclimate to. 
																	If the horse walks slower than you encourage them to stay at your elbow by waving the lunge whip behind you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Make a clucking noise with your mouth as a signal that you want your horse to move forward. 
																	This will teach the horse to rate the barrels. 
																	Professional exercise riders often take Thoroughbreds through their paces although in the US especially many jockeys participate in morning workouts at the track. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	BreakingPre Training A horse being lunged. 
																	As you master the basics and have a good foundation your horses speed will follow. 
																	Know where to look where to place your hands and where to add more leg. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses respond well to verbal cues. 
																	This means getting the colt or filly used to the weight of a saddle the tightening of the girth the feel of the bit in their mouth and then eventually the added weight of a rider. 
																	Keep the volume and length of the cluck consistent throughout training so that your horse doesnt get confused. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This process begins as soon as the sales are concluded. 
																	How to Train a Horse to Lead. 
																	Having a rope halter lead rope and lunge whip on-hand simply start by leading your horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The first step in training a race horse or any horse really is getting them accustomed to being handled and tacked up. 
																	The training mile is always done the way a race is run in a counterclockwise direction. 
																	Some people prefer to use a clicker instead of verbal clucking.

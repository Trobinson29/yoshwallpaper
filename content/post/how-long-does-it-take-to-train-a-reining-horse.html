					<p align="justify">I am just curious as to how long each day and how often or how many days out of the week you work each of your horses. Opportunities for newbies and returnees abound and the Internet is making it easier than ever for like-minded folks. It also gives you a free hand to open gates retrieve an item from your saddlebag point out a trail hazard pat your gelding etc. <br>

																	<strong>How long does it take to train a reining horse</strong>. 
								
																	Here is where youll want to begin. 
																	This is walk trot canter back side pass leads etc etc. 
																	A futurity takes a minimum of 16 months of training on cattle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Start off with 10 minutes of long reining at the very start and then progress up to 20 and 30 minutes and then increase the length of time according to your horses needs. 
																	Training a Therapy Horse Preparing a horse for Equine Assisted Therapy sessions is not as easy as one may first think. 
																	Plus I teach my clients to do the same. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Be aware with four months of training the horse will be working pretty darn good and hell have a good foundation on him but he sure wont be solid or ready to compete in a reining or cutting horse class. 
																	For most horses this process will take a minimum of 30 days. 
																	The horse should be confident and quiet with you and its surrounding. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To have a horse ready for tough competition usually takes 12 to 16 months or more. 
																	It helps you feel secure in your horses control level. 
																	Many people assume that because they have done some natural horsemanship training with their horse that they are now able to offer their horse to the general public for therapy programs. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	HorseRider Monthly Digital Issues. 
																	I have heard from a few people that horses only really are learning about the first 15 min. 
																	Just the basic stuff. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If the colt is an exceptionally fast learner you might get lucky and have him ready in just one year. 
																	Pick a quiet day and an enclosed field to begin with so that the horse will gain confidence in you and what you are asking them to do. 
																	Here Al Dunning covers four key matters he considers when asked to make the initial assessment in a potential reining horse and as training progresses.

	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">This scale is tested in movements where the horse is allowed to take the reins and stretch and in the free walk on a long rein. Some people do switch to a shanked bit once their horses are trained to neck rein but Ive found a smooth snaffle bit can offer great control for the horses entire life. By threading in lateral exercises such as leg yield shoulder-in travers and renvers we train horses to stay off the forehand. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Compared to other riding commands neck reining is fairly simple both to learn and to teach In general most horses should start to get the hang of neck reining within about six to ten training sessions.</b></h3>

																	<strong>How long does it take to train a horse to neck rein</strong>. 
								
																	Short Half Halts for a Long Neck In the late 1970s Melle van Bruggen coach of the American dressage team taught me an exercise that gives the feeling of a horse with a long neck. 
																	Otherwise most horses would be neck reining till they were in the bridle in a curb bit meaning there well broke basically lol. 
																	The term refers to the horses willingness to work over his back and topline to seek the riders contact. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you do proper ground work it should not take long at all If your horse is smart no time at all if its a little dull mined a little longerthe of course you have the steuben factor alsoNeck. 
																	Try doing this for about 15 minutes over several days. 
																	One of the key scales of training for dressage horses is suppleness. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If your horse tends to be a bit mouthy and nips. 
																	A long rein called a longe line may be used to allow the horse to move in a circle for training purposes or for the purpose of a clinical lameness evaluation by a veterinarian. 
																	By the time your horse is six he must be ridden with one hand and a curb bit at the breed shows. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Dont follow the same pattern each time you ride as you might find your horse learns the pattern and ignores the rein aids against his neck. 
																	Basically move the rein hand out just a bit so the reins are positioned maybe six inches or so up the neck. 
																	When horses are being started in snaffles people train them to neck rein then. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Several short sessions will be more effective than one long session. 
																	Depending on your horses age and experience your level of skill and the amount of time you have to ride this process can be taught in as little as three weeks or as long as several months. 
																	Carina Maiwald Getty Images Its easy and fun to teach your horse to neck rein. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Types of Rein Control When you ride two-handed you should be using an open rein a direct rein and an indirect rein. 
																	On certain designs of headgear a third rein may be added to the paired reins used for leading longeing or other specialized or stylistic purposes. 
																	By Lindsay Grice - Moving from direct reining in a snaffle bit to neck reining in a curb is like teaching your horse a new language and it takes time.

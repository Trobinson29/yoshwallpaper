					<p align="justify">Over 5000 horses leave the racing industry annually but sadly many of them face an uncertain future. Please note it is not a charity so is predominantly self-funded. If you can ride with different horses rather than the same one to prevent separation issues. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>The vast majority of ex-racehorses or any horses in work will be stabled through the winter months.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How do you retrain an ex racehorse</strong>. 
								
																	You get a great sense of achievement knowing that its all your hard work and effort that has gone into re-educating a horse. 
																	Racers to Riders TVs mini series on retraining ex racehorses featuring legendary Enlightened Equitation trainer author and saddle maker Heather Moffett. 
																	Understanding an ex-racehorses previous training for rein signals is paramount to being able to ride and retrain an ex-racehorse safely. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When you do begin to work your OTTB under the saddle use a general purpose or jumping saddle initially not a dressage saddle. 
																	Use your outside leg to move his shoulders over but keep your inside leg on the girth to stop him falling in. 
																	Give them time to settle in. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If youve made the decision to take on an ex-racehorse what are the first steps that you should take in its trainingWe ask the experts for their advice. 
																	Therefore start off riding with another horse whether out hacking they are usually good to hack and quiet in traffic or in the school. 
																	We asked some Harry Hall One Club members for their top tips on retraining ex-racehorses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Jett has been the most wonderful horse for me I have learnt so much and continue to do so every time a ride him. 
																	REHOMING RACEHORSES - A LIFE AFTER RACING is a Rehoming Programme run by Equine Management and Training. 
																	When retraining an ex-racehorse you really need to start his under saddle training from scratch. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	While ex-racehorses have technically been taught to be ridden theyre not taught in the same ways that you would train a typical riding horse. 
																	Remember the day the horse leaves the training yard its life is tipped upside down so that is when any behavioural or stress-related symptoms will kick in. 
																	Thoroughbreds off the track I believe have the most to give. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The Programme is primarily for the benefit of the racing industry taking horses straight out of training and ensuring that they have the best possible start to a new life. 
																	Having an insight into your horses previous experience is a good place to start. 
																	Ex-racehorses are trained to run to lean into the bridle and to go as fast as possible.

	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">I start them out in a fairly large circle at a trot then I make sure that I am balanced and cue for the lope. When training a horse to pick up leads you need to be able to use your opposite leg cue to move the hindquarter over. When teaching a green horse how to pick up his lead cheat a little bit. <br>

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a horse to pick up leads</strong>. 
								
																	How I get a young horse to pick up the correct lead is to work in a ton of circles. 
																	Horses to pick up one of their canter leads. 
																	You will practice positioning your horse alternately for the left lead and then switch to the right lead after a few strides. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I dont have time here to show you how to fix the problem but I do show you a common mi. 
																	The following are some simple exercises to help you pick up the right lead every time. 
																	If you want to keep up with the latest from the equestrian world without leaving home grab a HH subscription To help you with this type of training place two poles 22 steps apart. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses which are not balanced have sometimes problems to pick up the right lead. 
																	Lets say you decided to pick up. 
																	Practicing leg yields at the walk and trot helps your horse develop the suppleness and balance he needs to pick up the correct lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Tip his nose to the outside and hold your outside rein at the wither which blocks the shoulder from falling out. 
																	Set the jump at a height that will motivate the horse to take a small jump instead of trot over usually about 2ft place the jump several strides from the corner of a fenced arena trot towards the jump and the horse will naturally land in a canter. 
																	Jump into Canter - Intermediate or Advanced riders can use a small jump to help teach a stubborn or particularly one-sided horse to pick up the correct lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The first exercise is done completely in the walk. 
																	Shift your weight slightly to the inside seat bone. 
																	If you have worked on that and he is proficient at it then you need to. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Jump into Canter Intermediate or Advanced riders can use a small jump to help teach a stubborn or particularly one-sided horse to pick up the correct lead. 
																	Walk your horse along the arena rail in a clockwise direction. 
																	For instance to go from walk to right-lead canter time your leg aid so that you signal your horse the moment that he lifts his right front leg.

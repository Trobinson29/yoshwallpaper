																	<strong>How long does it take to break a horse to ride</strong>. 
								
																	In order to tame a horse the player must locate a wild horse. 
																	The 3rd week I saddle the horse and work it from the ground until I can saddle it anywhere with out tying the horse the 4th. 
																	I have been breaking and training horses for more than 50 years now I work a horse from the ground until I have the horse listening to me and responding to every voice command I give it this usually takes 3 to 4 weeks working every day from 1 to 3 hours with the horse.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once he is trotting comfortably and willingly for 5 minutes longer than your starting point add 3 to 5 minutes to the walk phase again. 
																	The Tevis western states 100 endurance riderace has 40000 feet of elevation change and is usually quite hot hence longer finishing times than a flat cool and low elevation eventYou are required to finish in 24 hours or less. 
																	Heft the saddle quickly and smoothly onto the pad and let it sit there for 1-2 minutes. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Rub it with the saddle pad before placing it on its back remembering to give praise. 
																	Do this until the left horse exhibits the desire to be left alone. 
																	With a wild horse the habits they pick up in the wild can be problematic. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In general most commercial trucking companies will stop every three to four hours. 
																	1 Overview 2 Tips 3 Trivia 4 Gallery 5 AchievementsTrophies 6 Related Content Horse taming becomes available during the mission Wild Horses Tamed Passions when Bonnie MacFarlane provides John Marston with a lasso. 
																	There have been horse breaking results that go as little as one week but usually the first 30 days to get the horse on board then add instructions the next 30 days. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horse Taming also known as horse breaking or just breaking is a method of habituating a wild horse to ridership. 
																	It is going to have to be consistent and I recommend daily this means 7 days a week. 
																	Longing should take around 15 to 20 minutes total. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Work the left horse around the pen using the same process I mentioned earlier for the under-saddle horse that doesnt want to leave his friends. 
																	Be prepared working with a wild horse is going to take more time. 
																	Where are you going and how long will the trip be.

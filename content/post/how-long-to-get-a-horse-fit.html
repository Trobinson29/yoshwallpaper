					<p align="justify">- A fit horse can take up to two weeks rest without loss of fitness so continue as normal - After that for every month off you need a weeks worth of walking on hacks ie. If you start your daily work under saddle the same principles apply. Excessive protein does not benefit the horse but may have adverse effects on performance and negative environmental consequences such as eutrophication explained Crandell. <br>

																	The merchant will know the benefits of the various feeds that are stocked. 
																	If your horse is getting up in years its a better idea to keep him in light work all year than to let him take three months off every winter. 
																	If your horse is less fit start with slow canter intervals of three to four minutes interspersed with walk breaks for two to three minutes depending on how quickly your horse recovers. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Plan on spending at least three months conditioning an older horse for pleasure trail riding and longer for more demanding tasks such as jumping. 
																	You want your horse to be long round and stretching before you start more taxing work to get the muscles in front of and behind the saddle soft and working gymnasts dont hop straight onto the top bar. 
																	Take one day at a time but make sure to provide regular consistent work rather than random or weekend sessions as inconsistent exercise can lead to discomfort and injuryOlder horse takes longer to return from time off consider keeping your horse as active as possible year-round. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Ideally walk for 10 minutes to start with but if your horse is fresh it is best to trot on to settle him down. 
																	After working a horses heart rate should return to normal within 15 minutes. 
																	Downtime is critical for older equine athletes. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For the higher-level events they now start doing fast work either on the gallops or through interval training. 
																	To get your horse fit start by walking it for 10 to 20 minutes a day. 
																	You can then slowly increase the amount of time it trots by a couple of minutes every other exercise session or so. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A good way to monitor your horses fitness level is by learning to take his pulse. 
																	By Anna Jane White-Mullin To bring your horse back to a state of fitness you should start with slow work mainly walking and trotting the first two weeks then adding some canter work the third week. 
																	After a week of these daily walks have it alternate between trotting and walking for 5 to 10 minutes each. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	So dont stop training your horse for a month or more because rebuilding the muscle flexibility and stamina takes more and more time as the years go by. 
																	Conditioning occurs when tissues are stressed then given time to recover as stronger fitter structures. 
																	Talk with your local feed merchant.

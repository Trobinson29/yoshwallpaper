																	<strong>How much do horses eat in winter</strong>. 
								
																	Make sure your horses water doesnt freeze over in winter temperatures. 
																	A horse should consume at least 15 to 175 percent of its body weight as hay during cold periods. 
																	An average adult horse should eat dry matter what remains after all of the water is evaporated out of a feed weighing around 153 per cent of its body weight. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses who spend much of their time in stalls arent doing much grazing but their natural feeding patterns can be replicated by keeping hay in front of them for most of the day. 
																	Being cold and wet is very chilling and a horse will eat a lot more to keep warm. 
																	Horses are meant to eat roughage and their digestive system is designed to use the nutrition in grassy stalks. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Our mares have free choice hay all year. 
																	How much should horses eat. 
																	They may also require. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Feeding horses during the winter can be a challenge. 
																	With little or no nutrition left in the grass horses living out full-time will need their grazing supplemented with hay. 
																	In all scenarios in winter months horses should be given at least 15 to 3 of their body weight in some form of forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For each 10-degree change below 30 degrees horses require an additional intake of approximately 2 pounds of feed per day assuming the feed has an energy density of 1 megacalorie per pound which is typical for most hay. 
																	A horse should eat one to two percent of their body weight in roughage every day. 
																	The lower critical temperature for horses with a heavy winter coat during dry calm weather is 30 F. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Our mares have free choice hay all year. 
																	Of hay per day. 
																	Thus a 1000-pound mature horse should consume 15 to 175 pounds of hay daily to meet critical temperature needs during cold weather.

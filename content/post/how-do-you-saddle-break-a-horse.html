					<p align="justify">Next place the saddle pad on your horses back for a few moments at a time doing this from both sides of the horse. Lift up the fender and apply a little baby powder and the squeaking should stop. In my experience this training takes the longest. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>All the young under 1 year horses that Ive had ended up with a very stong bonding from all the training time I spent on the ground with them.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How do you saddle break a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Once all of the above can be done comfortably you should introduce the saddle. 
																	Since you traditionally mount your horse on its left side approach it from that side. 
																	Heft the saddle quickly and smoothly onto the pad and let it sit there for 1-2 minutes. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This can take weeks days hours or minutes depending on the horse. 
																	Once the horse is comfortable with your weight on it youll be practically lying down on the horse you can attempt to get on. 
																	To calm the horse brush him as you do this. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The best way to break in a new saddle is to spend hours in it. 
																	To get the horse used to the saddle rub the saddle flap all up and down the horses body as you would when desensitizing. 
																	When I started the riding work after 3 years of gound work they were willing to do pretty much whatever I asked and their training under the saddle was some of the easiest Ive had. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Place the saddle on your horses back. 
																	For new stiff fenders train the leather to bend so your stirrups hang perpendicular to the horse. 
																	Rub it with the saddle pad before placing it on its back remembering to give praise. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	But it can be done when theyre younger or older if you do it progressively. 
																	Avoid using a heavy pad ride for 20 to 30 minutes then stop get off take the saddle off and see if there are any hot spots on the horses back says Covey. 
																	There are two ways to break a horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	By the way I like to call this training act starting under saddle. 
																	You do it the same way you do it with any other horseRight now Im helping my trainer break a mini to saddleIm extremely shortyou start on a lunge line with the saddle on then you put the long line on them like you were going to drive them and you back themIf you dont have a short person we put a light sack of grain and tie it to the saddle and after we do that we put a mannequin on. 
																	When the colt is comfortable with a saddle blanket and your weight start wrapping things around his back and belly.

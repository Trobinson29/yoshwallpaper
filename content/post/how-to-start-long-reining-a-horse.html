																	<strong>How to start long reining a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Pick a quiet day and an enclosed field to begin with so that the horse will gain confidence in you and what you are asking them to do. 
																	You can long-rein in straight lines which is low stress and low intensity and it is effectively like riding your horse but from the ground says Brendan. 
																	The handler is positioned behind the horse holding a lunge line in each hand just like a set of reins. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The lines are then unclipped and removed from the bit and the saddle or roller. 
																	Hold the lines as you would reins when youre riding from your horses mouth to your hand between your little finger and ring finger and up across your palm with thumbs on top. 
																	The sight of your panicked horse belting off with long reins flapping round its legs is not a fun one. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Start your horse down the fence or wall toggling between walking directly behind or at a Â¾-angle while pushing and releasing your horses hip into position. 
																	Long-reining is conducted from the ground. 
																	Once youre confident your horse is comfortable being long reined with both reins on one side start to bring the crossed rein back across the horses body so that one rein is to your horses left and the other to their right. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You should now be in the long reining position. 
																	As a prerequisite to long reining you certainly need to have the horse lunging correctly before you even think about starting to long rein. 
																	In theory long-reining can be likened to riding from the ground. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Long Reining is a fantastic way to teach the horse how to start to collect his body without the added weight of the rider which might throw off the delicate. 
																	The thing I want to talk about with long reining is it is a very dangerous thing to do for riders and for horses. 
																	Begin in the directly behind position and ask your horse to simply walk forward along the fence with you following him. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can use half-halts a squeeze and. 
																	Attach the off-side first and then place the excess line on the back of the horse while you attach the near-side. 
																	Long lining is not just for training big horses -- its how Lancelot the mini appaloosa struts his stuff photo by Christiane Slawik.

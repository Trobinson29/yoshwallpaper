																	<strong>How to teach a young horse balance</strong>. 
								
																	This video shows an exercise we use with younggreen horses to help them find their balance and take the correct leads. 
																	Its important that your horse is warmed up correctly and cooled down properly after this workout to avoid injury or strain. 
																	A stiff horse will fall around turns and circles. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Set up three bounces made up of cross poles. 
																	As I mentioned before you as the rider must be balanced in your seat and able to move with your horse as he works forward. 
																	The question is about leading your horse and why Caroline teaches. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	After the bounces set up a vertical one stride away from the bounces followed by an oxer two strides after the vertical. 
																	Try riding a step or two of turn on the forehand at the walk before each corner to engage your horses inside hind leg for bending into corners. 
																	Because foals arent full grown and dont have the same stamina as. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If youre starting your young horse in the wintertime make sure the bit is warm. 
																	Teach him to bend instead so he follows curved lines with an aligned spine. 
																	Teach Leading Skills At this point youve probably already haltered the kid. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	They follow the Foal Training Series teaching the young horses all 36 exercises included in it. 
																	Once the young horses learn to lead with a halter many of the exercises they are taught come straight from the Fundamentals groundwork exercises modified for a young horse. 
																	A bit that is too low or too high will cause discomfort and you want to encourage your horse to hold the bit quietly. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you hear 1-2-3-4 your horse is four-beating and you need to ride him more forward almost into a lengthening to create rhythm in the gait. 
																	Ride transitions before your corners teaching the horse to listen to your aids for coming back then engage to go forward through the corner. 
																	Young horses heal faster too making getting cut less stressful now than it would be later on in life.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Obviously many people keep horses on smaller amounts of land and do not depend on the land to provide any forage.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much land do you have to have to keep a horse</strong>. 
								
																	But it can be done on far less if you bring horses in at night in winter restrict access in wet weather ie dont turn out at all feed hay in winter have a trash paddock sectioned. 
																	Day yards or holding yards should be at least 3 m wide and be an area of at least 20 square metres. 
																	BHS say that to keep a horse out 247 all year round without needing to feed extra hay you need 15 acres for the first horse and 1 acre per horse after that. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If the property is governed by Yavapai County. 
																	Horses need daily care regardless of the weather schedules or holidays. 
																	Do your homework work with an equestrian real estate specialist and your horses will thank you for it. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You will also need a stable or a well ventalated and well protected shed for your horsehorses. 
																	Onc e you find out the zoning designation of the property you can easily figure out whether or not horses are allowed. 
																	One acre is 43560 square feet or approximately 210 feet x 210 feet. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Where a roof or canopy is provided it should be high enough to avoid injuring a rider or fractious horse. 
																	In smaller turnout pens its critical to remove manure frequently to avoid a buildup which can attract flies or produce an odor. 
																	Not only do. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Alaska California Maryland Nevada New York and Pennsylvania. 
																	A height of 37 m is adequate. 
																	Keeping a horse on your own property is a 365 day a year job. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	According to Washington State University the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse though a larger space would be more appropriate Kenney said. 
																	One of the most important questions you need to ask yourself is do you have time to look after a horse or pony. 
																	Even without the laws the recommended pasture acreage to support one horse is 25 acres.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>You should discuss your bespoke programme with your own trainer but here are some general guidelines.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to get a horse fit for eventing</strong>. 
								
																	Your horses fitness programme will depend on his type your facilities and his current fitness level. 
																	After a week of these daily walks have it alternate between trotting and walking for 5 to 10 minutes each. 
																	Its surprising how fast you can get a horse fit with this easy regimen. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Depending on your discipline it will take 8-10 weeks to get your horse fit. 
																	A good guideline for a horse who is already in work but needs to up his fitness ahead of an event is to do five minutes of canter followed by three minutes of walk. 
																	Then ask your horse to slow canter for a total of nine minutes remember we are starting out gradually and progressively. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can also do a little jumping at this point doing gymnastics one day a week and practicing on single lines another day. 
																	Do exercises at each gait that improve flexibility and strength. 
																	To get your horse fit start by walking it for 10 to 20 minutes a day. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	TIP 2 To be fit enough to compete at the early spring events your horse needs to be in full work. 
																	Build up to slow cantering a total of 12 minutes cantering three sets of four minutes each with brief intervals of walk in between the sets. 
																	Often it helps to go with a buddy to pass the time and keep the horses interested. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Getting your horse fit for a three-day-event. 
																	Do that twice and end the session. 
																	This method of training is commonly used to get event horses ready for the season. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can then slowly increase the amount of time it trots by a couple of minutes every other exercise session or so. 
																	Start by power-walking for 30 minutes a day and within two weeks gradually work up to 60 minutes. 
																	Get him moving and be sure he lifts his back while he marches purposefully forward.

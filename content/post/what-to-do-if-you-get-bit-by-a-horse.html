						<h3 class="h5"><b>Constant bit chewing is often a sign of nervousness particularly in younger horses or discomfort.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>What to do if you get bit by a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Do not encourage playful behaviours eg. 
																	Symptoms of Snake Bite in Horses. 
																	Horses are one of the most sensitive animals when it comes to snakes bite followed by sheep cows goats and pigs. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Another method to curb biting is to teach the horse to focus on an object. 
																	Outfit your horse in a snaffle bit. 
																	Horses that habitually nip have very active minds and need to keep busy. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The biting habit can start when the horse is quite young. 
																	Nipping that could lead to bites. 
																	An experienced helper or a friend with a good pair of eyes is another help since a lot of on the bit is the horses silhouette and frame. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You want him to associate his effort to bite with a distracting tap on his shin. 
																	The main precaution for treating horsefly bites is to be wary of infection. 
																	Wear a helmet so if the horse bites it doesnt injure your head. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Wear protective footwear and clothing so if the horse bites your arm he will get a mouthful of clothing rather than you. 
																	Pay attention to what you are doing around horses to reduce the risk of being bitten. 
																	Do NOT create pain just surprise. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Youll be riding with two hands for clearest communication. 
																	You should cleanse the bite and apply over-the-counter antiseptic spray or ointment to help keep the wound clean and decrease irritation and itchiness. 
																	Clicker training is a good way to keep a busy mind occupied.

There is still some debate about this percentage but the general rule of thumb is that a horse should carry between 15 to 20 percent of their weight. <br>

																	<strong>How much do you have to weigh to go horseback riding</strong>. 
								
																	A 545-kilogram 1200 pound horse then would be best off carrying no more than 109 kg 240 lbs of tack and rider. 
																	A lighter jockey can have better control and lessen the burden on the horse. 
																	If you fit between the horn and the cantle of a 20 inch saddle.

																	That is why the weight is so important.

																	A study published in the Journal of Veterinary Behaviour suggests that the rider should weigh less than 15 percent of their horses body weight. 
																	When it comes to being a successful jockey weight matters. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Interestingly this research from the Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute has concluded with the same weight guideline as the US Calvary Manuals of Horse Management published in 1920. 
																	That is 20 inches from the front of you to the back of you. 
																	250 lbs is way too heavy for any of the horses to handle especially on the mountain trails. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	There is no exact weight limit for horseback riding but as a general rule horses should not carry more than 20 of their total body weight. 
																	Jockeys weigh in often and follow a strict diet and exercise regimen to meet average jockey height and weight requirements. 
																	Our weight limit is 250 pounds and it is non-negotiable. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	What is the weight limit for horseback riding. 
																	This includes the weight of the tack as well as the rider. 
																	When you make a horseback riding reservation it is important that you enter both your weight and experience level so that we can arrange an appropriate horse for you.

																	1 0 Kala 1 decade ago. 
																	They will be ridden daily and will be supplemented with good quality hay and grain. 
																	That stands for Residential R single family 1 homes L-means no manufactured homes and 70 means that the lot must be a minimum of 70000 sq ft. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	According to Washington State Universitys Managing Small-Acreage Horse Farms the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse although a larger space would be more desirable. 
																	In small turnout pens its critical to pick manure daily have a well-thought-out manure management plan and divert clean water away from the dry lots. 
																	In smaller turnout pens its critical to remove manure frequently to avoid a buildup which can attract flies or produce an odor. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Some areas you need to have an acre of land per horseothers have NO zoning for horses so you are not allowed to have horses on your landothers have no requirements. 
																	Not only do. 
																	KEEPING TOO MANY HORSES IN A SMALL FIELD - OVERGRAZING. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Onc e you find out the zoning designation of the property you can easily figure out whether or not horses are allowed. 
																	Where a roof or canopy is provided it should be high enough to avoid injuring a rider or fractious horse. 
																	According to Washington State University the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse though a larger space would be more appropriate Kenney said. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If your horse is a small pony then it might be quite happy on half an acre and people do keep minis perfectly happily in larger yards. 
																	They would only be allowed about 1-2 hours of grass daily and will each have a stall and a sacrifice area for the time that they are not on pasture. 
																	Obviously many people keep horses on smaller amounts of land and do not depend on the land to provide any forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Be sure you know that you will be spending at least 20001835 at first then roughly 120184 a month after that per horse depending on livery costs and how much you want to spend pampering them. 
																	A height of 37 m is adequate. 
																	However this does not take into account various mitigating factors.

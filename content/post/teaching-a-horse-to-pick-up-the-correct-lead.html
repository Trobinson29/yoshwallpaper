	<h1>Teaching A Horse To Pick Up The Correct Lead</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">The concept of leads at the canter or lope is simple enoughWhen a horse is on the correct lead he starts each stride with the outside hind leg and ends it with the inside foreleg. But unless the rider has control of the horses outside shoulder the result is often not the desired one. Hunterjumper rider and trainer Sloane Coles shares some exercises to help your horse learn to pick up the proper lead at the canter. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Use her simple consistent plan to help your horse strengthen his weaker side and listen to your cues and hell get the correct lead every time you ask.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>Teaching a horse to pick up the correct lead</strong>. 
								
																	For instance to go from walk to right-lead canter time your leg aid so that you signal your horse the moment that he lifts his right front leg. 
																	If you bend the. 
																	Right now just know that this position makes it hard for your horse to pick up the correct lead in two ways. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The set-up the cue and the release. 
																	Jump into Canter Intermediate or Advanced riders can use a small jump to help teach a stubborn or particularly one-sided horse to pick up the correct lead. 
																	Set the jump at a height that will motivate the horse to take a small jump instead of trot over usually about 2ft place the jump several strides from the corner of a fenced arena trot towards the jump and the horse will naturally land in a canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The Set-Up The key to getting the correct lead every time is to set the. 
																	When it comes to bending the head to the outside you have to be careful youre not BENDING it. 
																	If not sit back down move your aids back to the sitting trot and repeat. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Just before you end the circle keep the bend and then ask for the canter transition. 
																	Take your time and get comfortable helping your horse pick up the correct lead consistently and slowly start incorporating simple lead changes and building up with exercises to help find that flying change. 
																	As in you want to flex the poll to the outside but dont want to bend the neck. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As a general rule the horse will pick up whatever canter lead he is bent and flexed toward. 
																	When you are ready to ask for the canter you must pick the right moment because the horse who is now ready to respond immediately will take the lead according to where his legs are when you ask. 
																	And 2 With his hips to the outside like this his outside hind leg isnt positioned to take that first step of the lope stride. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Teaching your horse to lope off on the correct lead can be achieved in three simple steps. 
																	1 It causes him to lean on his inside shoulder which keeps him from lifting that shoulder to free his inside front leg and balance over his hind end. 
																	Riders cue their horses to encourage this sequence and quickly learn to recognize by sight and feel when a lead is wrong.

																	<strong>What to do when riding a new horse</strong>. 
								
																	Grooming your horse is a pleasant way to bond. 
																	When you go to look at a horse bring a jacket with you any kind of jacket. 
																	3 Get your legs in the right position. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This may seem like a shortcut to an obedient horse. 
																	If you get scared your reaction might be to toss the reins and hold on for dear life. 
																	Only 45min away from Queenstown in Glenorchy. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horses move their heads when they move and if a rider does not accommodate this movement they will have the reins pulled through their hands. 
																	Your horse will appreciate it when you can brush areas it cant get to like its chest belly and between the legs. 
																	Join the quest with High Country Horses or Dart River Adventures. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Make sure you have both of your feet placed comfortably in the stirrups. 
																	Hold the reins in your hand or hands as your instructor directs. 
																	Even if you are scared hold onto those reins and listen to what your guide or coach is telling you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Undo the nose band and the throat latch. 
																	The best way to do this if youre an inexperienced rider is to find an equestrian center or horse ranch in your area that leases horses or provides horseback riding lessons for inexperienced beginners. 
																	Sadly there are trainers out there who think it acceptable to withhold food or water to punish a horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Western riders usually use one hand while English riders use two Sit deep and relaxed in the saddle and keep the reins slightly loose. 
																	Your fences and stable should be ready. 
																	Preparing to ride a horse is easy as long as you have the right gear and know how to saddle and bridle your horse.

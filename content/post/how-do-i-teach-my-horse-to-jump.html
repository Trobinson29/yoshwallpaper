					<p align="justify">While in the air you should practice a release by moving your hands forward up the neck. The design of the Swedish oxer is similar to a cross pole in that it helps the horse to pick up his knees as the perceived height of the fence is higher. Once your horse has a feel for jumping and knows really where to put his feet remove the trotting poles and the add individual jumps around the arena. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>The bascule or curl is the shape that the horse makes over a fence and is another key skill for the successful show jumper.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How do i teach my horse to jump</strong>. 
								
																	Once they have become comfortable with this you can begin incrementally increasing the height of the jumps. 
																	The first jump is a crossed pole but she should be trotting over one or two or three poles in front of the jump. 
																	Cross rails give you and your horse a center point to help keep you straight before and after the jump. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Start with five poles placing them either in a straight line or on a circle four yards 36 metres apart. 
																	Your first horse jump should be a simple cross rail. 
																	This is in an X formation using two rails crossed in the middle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This move will keep the horse balanced and free to stretch its neck. 
																	Cantering over the poles will also help your horse as well. 
																	You should look forward and keep your seat secure during the jump. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you just leave them dangling your horse could catch his leg and send both of you tumbling to the ground. 
																	It also helps to keep the horse straight in the middle of the fence rather than jumping off to one side. 
																	Do not then be tempted to raise the jump she needs to learn to jump more economically. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Canter over them on both reins and once your horse has established a good canter through. 
																	Be aware that the young horse will over-jump so use a neck rein and give her plenty of rein. 
																	This will teach your horse keep going at a controlled pace after each jump. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Im just glad she did not fall in the hole or get hurt the other day she jumped a small pole I thought she. 
																	Ok I am not sending her to a trainer. 
																	For the first grid put.

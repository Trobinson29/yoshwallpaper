																	<strong>How much land do you need to graze a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Therefore less acreage is needed to meet the grazing needs of each horse. 
																	Unfortunately it is not quite as simple as this although it can be used as a very rough guide. 
																	You might need as many as forty acres of land to meet the forage needs of a single horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pasture land that provides a healthy mix of natural grasses along with edible trees can satisfy a horses needs year round. 
																	Do you think this would be enough land. 
																	At the farm i work at she has about 3 acres of land w 20 horses out at once but all separated. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	But good management means that the field must be kept free of dung by collection and that the field should be divided up with electrified tape especially in the grass growing season. 
																	If you are attempting to figure the carrying capacity of land for a horse then a good rule of thumb is 1-12 to 2 acres of open intensely managed land per horse. 
																	If you decided to graze your 100 head of 1400-pound cows for only 2 months you could graze your cows on 280 acres. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you reduce the number of cows you have or the time allowed to graze you can reduce the amount of land needed to raise your animals on. 
																	Another idea you could do is if you have like 10 horses to an acre is to fence off parts of that acre to keep the horses separate. 
																	Pennsylvania pastures that receive adequate rainfall will grow more forage than dry land pasture. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	And like everyone else said too depends on your climate. 
																	An acre of land equals 43560 square feet 210 X 210. 
																	In smaller turnout pens its critical to remove manure frequently to avoid a buildup which can attract flies or produce an odor. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In the UK we can take 1 -15 acres per horse providing the field is flat and the sub surface relatively hard and horses have not turned the field sour. 
																	According to Washington State Universitys Managing Small-Acreage Horse Farms the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse although a larger space would be more desirable. 
																	They would only be allowed about 1-2 hours of grass daily and will each have a stall and a sacrifice area for the time that they are not on pasture.

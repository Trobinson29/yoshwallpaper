													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach your horse to trail ride</strong>. 
								
																	You dont want to be held up by other riders who only want to walk. 
																	Then when they are okay with that try having it on the opposite side. 
																	Teach your horse to. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The horse wants to remove the pressure and will take action to make the pressure stop. 
																	All of these things get his attention back to his job and back to you and off of whatever he thought was a big wooly booger. 
																	Before you go for your first trail ride your horse should be relaxed enough to rest head at neutral eyes half closed with you just sitting on them in a relaxed manner. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Whether youre riding or working your horse from the ground make him keep his nose in front of his body between the two points of his shoulders. 
																	A longer trail ride or a ride in demanding terrain or at a speeds faster than a walk require the horse to be in good condition. 
																	4 When a horse starts to hesitate and starts to show fear ride hard and fast. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	At some point youre going to come to water that you have to cross and if your horse refuses youre going to have a problem says Field. 
																	Proper conditioning may include a half hours ride a day the first few days increased to an hour or more daily one week later finally increased to two hours suggested Wayne Loch in a publication for University of. 
																	This is a key indication he respects you as leader. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When you get two or more horses on the trail they have a tendency to want to race one another and get reactive. 
																	Go faster cover more ground ride off of the trail and in the roughest footing you can find. 
																	If hes looking to either side of his body hes seeking an escape route illustrating that hes neither paying attention to you nor does he trust that you will keep him safe. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	One of the most basic principles or riding or teaching a horse is that pressure motivates and release teaches Squeezing with your legs to ask a horse to move forward or pulling gently on the reins to turn is applying pressure. 
																	Training for the trail should begin in the arena or a similar safe confined environment. 
																	Try not to squeeze repeatedly with your legs once the horse is walking.

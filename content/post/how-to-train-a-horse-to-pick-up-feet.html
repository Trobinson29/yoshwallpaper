	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Try to keep the arm on the leg until he stops kicking out and is comfortable with it. Make sure he gets in the right state of mind before you go to handle his legs. The horse gets frustrated because he doesnt know what the trainer is asking and the trainer often goes too fast too soon. <br>

																	<strong>How to train a horse to pick up feet</strong>. 
								
																	Start by gently squeezing the cap of the hock then increase the pressure by squeezing harder and harder. 
																	When you make the boots tighter. 
																	This can get dangerous when working with back feet because an irriated frustrated horse is more likely to take a kick at the trainer. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	First you have to pick out the spot. 
																	Your horse apparently feels more weight on his her legs so they pick their feet up. 
																	Run your hand down his foreleg and when you reach the chestnut dig your fingertips into the leg just below it. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Hold the horse in one hand and use the false arm to touch his legs while staying out of reach. 
																	The slightest signs of tension can show up with a skin twitch fidgeting irritation or general resistance. 
																	Every time the horse lifts the leg youre next to reward. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The idea is the horse knows the spot and is comfy there. 
																	Enjoy the videos and music you love upload original content and share it all with friends family and the world on YouTube. 
																	So reading the horse is key and spotting tension is your main focus. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Keep a hand on its shoulder or hip and give it a light push just before that leg leaves the ground so it will associate that cue with the activity of lifting the leg and the reward. 
																	Teaching a horse to pick up its feet can be a frustrating job. 
																	As soon as the horse responds by taking his weight off his leg immediately release the pressure and rub his leg. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Rub hesitate stimulate and then go back to rubbing as soon as your horse lifts a foot. 
																	Michelle Quirico MQ Training is based out of the North Bay at American Canyon Training Center in Napa CA. 
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>The cost of shoeing a horse often is the only factor people take into account when deciding whether or not to shoe their horses.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How often do you have to re shoe a horse</strong>. 
								
																	Horse owners typically have both their shod and barefooted horses seen by farriers every four to six weeks for maintenance. 
																	We shod three times a year as kids. 
																	The answer is normally every 6 weeks. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Regardless of if you decide to shoe your horse or let them go barefoot you should schedule them to see a farrier at regular intervals throughout the year. 
																	Put shoes on a horse that will be walking on rocky ground. 
																	Wild horses amble long distances daily usually over rough grassland which gradually builds up hard hooves. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	There are a number of signs you can look for that your horses shoes need to be reset. 
																	Domestic horses do not always require shoes. 
																	If you decide to do it yourself clean the horses feet well and make sure you have shoes that fit the horses front and back feet. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its about performance and being ready all the time. 
																	Many horses are fine with front shoes only and many do not need shoes at all. 
																	Rocky ground can lead to pain if your horse does not have shoes. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Danvers and I figured it out and you have about a 15-year run to make about 60 percent of the money that youre going to earn in the lifetime of shoeing horses. 
																	As a rule of thumb you should plan to have the farrier reset your horses shoes approximately every six weeks. 
																	There have been great advances in hoofboots in the last few years and many horse owners prefer to use them rather than keep a horse continuously shod. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When possible a barefoot hoof at least for part of every year is a healthy option for most horses. 
																	Solve the system by the elimination method. 
																	Plan to pull your horses shoes during a time when you can either give him time off.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>To teach a young horse to jump you must have very good balance and a good eye ability to judge distances to jumps and determine the proper striding to them.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a young horse to jump</strong>. 
								
																	Typically it is a pole on the ground 6 feet in distance then a low jump cross-rail then one-stride 18 to 20 feet to an oxer. 
																	Start with coloured poles on the floor building up from one to a row of five approx 1m apart. 
																	It also helps to keep the horse straight in the middle of the fence rather than jumping off to one side. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can add two more poles after the jump but set them far and wide enough so your horse wont step on them on landing. 
																	Make sure you have someone there either watching you for safety reasons or an instructor that has had experience with training young horses to jump. 
																	Use an average distance of 25m increase distance as jump jump gets larger. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	How to teach a horse to jump a hedge 1. 
																	If your horse is finding it difficult to stay straight lay a channel with two poles in front of the jump ride between them to the cross pole to help him keep direction. 
																	If he rushes to the next obstacle halt him after each jump until he learns to not speed off. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The first step in teaching a horse to jump is to send it through a free jump exercise. 
																	Once they have become comfortable with this you can begin incrementally increasing the height of the jumps. 
																	Training young event horses to jump safely and confidently Dont be afraid to adjust the poles to your horses stride as you are working on building your horses confidence. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You must be able to help him stay in balance too. 
																	You can train your horse to jump by having them first become comfortable trotting and cantering over ground poles then slowly working your way towards a small jump over a cross rail. 
																	The pole sets the horse up for the low jump and the low jump sets it up for the oxer. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Allowing him to. 
																	Using cross poles in your training sessions will help your horse to stay straight because he will naturally come into the centre of the jump. 
																	Add a placing pole in between the second oxer and the Swedish oxer.

																	<strong>How to train a horse to pick up the correct lead</strong>. 
								
																	Start trotting in a circle and have the ground pole right before the circle touches the fence if your riding in an arena Otherwise just put the pole where you want your horse to canter from. 
																	Right now just know that this position makes it hard for your horse to pick up the correct lead in two ways. 
																	If you watch horses play in the pasture most will choose the correct lead when cantering through tight turns or switch to it at some point to steady themselves. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Note that the horse must begin the canter stride with his outside hind leg so that he finishes up on the correct lead. 
																	Jump into Canter - Intermediate or Advanced riders can use a small jump to help teach a stubborn or particularly one-sided horse to pick up the correct lead. 
																	Sit up straight and centered in the saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Do plenty of transitions but dont push him to pick up a particular lead. 
																	Flex your horse to the left by turning your left wrist as if youre unlocking a door. 
																	But unless the rider has control of the horses outside shoulder the result is often not the desired one. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Go back to basics and make sure you have hip rib and. 
																	If he does not pick up his left lead. 
																	Once your horse has gotten used to the halter place it over its head and muzzle and attach the lead line. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Lets say you decided to pick up left lead. 
																	It is extremely common for riders to try to get their horses to take a specific lead by turning them in the direction of the lead. 
																	1 It causes him to lean on his inside shoulder which keeps him from lifting that shoulder to free his inside front leg and balance over his hind end. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	And shape your own body for the left lead. 
																	Because thats how saddle seat people do it and thats how we teach all the kids in the lesson program. 
																	We need to teach him how to pick up the canter by turning his head to the outside and using the outside leg.

	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">The horse should remain on the bit with the poll as the highest point. The last step of training your horse to respond to neck reining cues is starting to hold your reins in a loose neck reining style. The sliding stop is a special trick in which your horse lowers its hindquarters as it comes to halt. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach your horse reining</strong>. 
								
																	Keep a gentle contact with your horses mouth until the next time you ask it to stop or turn. 
																	Walk your horse in a circle in either direction asking him to follow his nose by making contact with your inside direct rein. 
																	The art of perfecting your stop is an ongoing process. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can begin teaching a reining horse the basics of a spin by getting control of their shoulders. 
																	Lift your hand so the rein makes clear and positive contact against the mid-section of the neck. 
																	Whether youre teaching a young horse or just want to sharpen your broke horse it takes practice. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	At the same time lay the outside rein against the side of the horses neck. 
																	Reinforce the small circles and direct-rein cue with light leg pressure with the outside leg in position one. 
																	Start Guiding Your Horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	With the horse motionless lay the neck rain and open your inside hand so that you can gently pull the nose of the horse in the direction of the spin. 
																	Start off at a gentle walk then cue your horse to turn with a direct rein. 
																	Common reining movements include circles flying changes rundowns backups spins sliding stops rollbacks and pauses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Walk in a straight line then turn a sharp corner of about a 90-degree angle. 
																	To teach your gelding to neck rein you may use either a one-piece rein or split reins. 
																	As you turn the corner cue with the inside rein your seat and legs aids as usual but lay the outside rein against the horses neck. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As the horse obeys the cue release the pressure of your hand and leg. 
																	With consistent practice your horse can stop turn and transition based on body cues alone. 
																	This rein length will allow you to cross the reins over your horses neck so that you can hold both reins with one hand in the center.

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a horse to back under saddle</strong>. 
								
																	Then put a little pressure on the rein and speak and tell him back and he will. 
																	Teaching a horse to do anything under saddle usually starts on the ground. 
																	This tapping of the brakes may have notified the horse that the rider was aware of his speed. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Another important thing is that during a well-executed stop your horse should stop by putting more weight on his rear other than just his front legs. 
																	By yielding the horses hindquarters youre putting energy in his feet and then just redirecting it backwards. 
																	Since you traditionally mount your horse on its left side approach it from that side. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Backing up helps your horse to exercise the muscles that he will need to be able to stop better. 
																	If the horse is pushy and tends to try and walk in front of you immediately stop and make the horse back up. 
																	Rub it with the saddle pad before placing it on its back remembering to give praise. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As you use your legs squeeze both hands on the reins then immediately relax your hands but dont drop contact. 
																	But it didnt work as a cue to slow down. 
																	If your horse knows how to back up on ground then you can do it under saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Repeat until the horse responds correctly. 
																	Simply if you teach your horse to back up from the saddle stopping and slowing down will also improve. 
																	Pressure from your legs will encourage your horse to step under themselves with their hind legs and push up through their back. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When I introduce backing up to a horse I always start by yielding the horses hindquarters first and then asking the horse to back up a step. 
																	To get your horse to properly carry themselves you want to have your horse on the bit stretching through their back and neck. 
																	On ground put a little bit of pressure on his nose with your hand and he will backup.

																	<strong>How to teach horse to pick up back feet</strong>. 
								
																	Pinch or twist your horses chestnut just enough to make him notice and lift his foot in response. 
																	Repeat several times if necessary. 
																	Hell get his fidgets and kicks out and will basically learn its a pointless effort. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Take a lead rope and loop it around his pastern without tying. 
																	Try to keep the arm on the leg until he stops kicking out and is comfortable with it. 
																	Just hold each end securely without tying it because if something happens its a quick release. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Do not attempt to lift his leg up. 
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground. 
																	As soon as the horse responds by taking his weight off his leg immediately release the pressure and rub his leg. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I have had my horses for a few weeks and they are just now letting me pick up their back feet but I would never tie them up doesnt seem right for me and if I was the horse I dont think that would make me want to pick them up for anyone. 
																	Michelle Quirico MQ Training is based out of the North Bay at American Canyon Training Center in Napa CA. 
																	Its possible to teach any horse to pick up their feet on command. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Todays video is about how to work with a horses feet who either hasnt had it done very much or doesnt cooperate very well having it doneSometimes pickin. 
																	Okay well first of all he is a 2 year old andy x aussie riding pony i put horse so that more people would look at it other wise if i put pony they might have thought oh its just being stubborn I can pick out his front feet just fine but when it comes to his back feet will not let me lift them at ALL but if i am lucky enough to lift them he kicks out HARD. 
																	Keep a hand on its shoulder or hip and give it a light push just before that leg leaves the ground so it will associate that cue with the activity of lifting the leg and the reward. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In this weeks Quick Tips for Horse Owners Krista Eichler shows us how to train your horses to lift their feet for you. 
																	Put the horse on a small circle around you and keep asking it to move over. 
																	Just ask him to pick up his feet a few times and hold it up with the rope.

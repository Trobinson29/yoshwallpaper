													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much grass does a horse eat in winter</strong>. 
								
																	That being said he might colic for other reasons. 
																	A horse should eat one to two percent of their body weight in roughage every day. 
																	This totals 27kg of forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	While grasses are the preferred forage for horses in the winter horses may have to resort to eating shrubs for the major portion. 
																	During the switch to a 100 percent hay diet in the fall of the year is when many horse owners first notice that some of their horses are getting loose manure. 
																	Feeding horses during the winter can be a challenge. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	However during winter months many fields are bare and the grass that is available has little nutrition. 
																	Horses living out in winter can happily eat frosted grass every morning for weeks on end without suffering any adverse effect he says. 
																	Hammer also explains A 10- to 15-mph wind will require horses to consume an additional 4 to 8 pounds of hay to meet their increased energy requirements. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A high quality grass hay will have a DE of around 19 Mcalkg while average pasture is 226 or 12 times greater so the 369 kg of grass 12 x 369 443 kg of hay. 
																	Early spring winter and fall may slow grass growth and make the grass less than optimum for your horse. 
																	With little or no nutrition left in the grass horses living out full-time will need their grazing. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	They should also have access to salt at all times and unlimited ice free water. 
																	Again each horse is an individual so what works for one might not be suitable for another. 
																	Dehydration is a real threat in winter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Watch your horses condition and for signs of weight loss. 
																	It could be in the form of long stem hay chopped hays forage based cubes or combinations thereof. 
																	Growing to a height of 2 to 4 feet the seed may be sown in wet or dry conditions with germination occurring after a good rain if planted on a dry day.

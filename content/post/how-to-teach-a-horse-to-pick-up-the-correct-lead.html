	<h1>How To Teach A Horse To Pick Up The Correct Lead</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Riders cue their horses to encourage this sequence and quickly learn to recognize by sight and feel when a lead is wrong. The concept of leads at the canter or lope is simple enoughWhen a horse is on the correct lead he starts each stride with the outside hind leg and ends it with the inside foreleg. Horses which are not balanced have sometimes problems to pick up the right lead. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach a horse to pick up the correct lead</strong>. 
								
																	For instance to go from walk to right-lead canter time your leg aid so that you signal your horse the moment that he lifts his right front leg. 
																	Your left leg is on the girth asking the horse to pick up the canter. 
																	A roll back to the outside brings the horse in a position to shift the weigh. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Tip his nose to the outside and hold your outside rein at the wither which blocks the shoulder from falling out. 
																	This idea is the foundation of many elements of training but is also particularly useful when horses are learning how to pick up the correct canter lead. 
																	For me the most important thing you can teach your horse is to carry itself rather than to constantly rely on the rider for balance. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When teaching a green horse how to pick up his lead cheat a little bit. 
																	This idea is the foundation of many elements of training but. 
																	The first thing the horse needs to learn is how to yield to pressure one of those basic skills that should have been taught when he was halter-broke but as Amy points out. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	For me the most important thing you can teach your horse is to carry itself rather than to constantly rely on the rider for balance. 
																	It is often a bit of. 
																	Sit up straight and centered in the saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Note that the horse must begin the canter stride with his outside hind leg so that he finishes up on the correct lead. 
																	Shift your weight slightly to the inside seat bone. 
																	Practicing leg yields at the walk and trot helps your horse develop the suppleness and balance he needs to pick up the correct lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Walk your horse along the arena rail in a clockwise direction. 
																	When you are ready to ask for the canter you must pick the right moment because the horse who is now ready to respond immediately will take the lead according to where his legs are when you ask. 
																	Your right leg should be slightly behind the girth asking the horses right hind leg to strike off into left canter.

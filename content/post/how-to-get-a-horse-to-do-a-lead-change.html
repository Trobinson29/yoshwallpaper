						<h3 class="h5"><b>This is an easy exercise when the horse is calm and straight and has a good quality canter.</b></h3>

																	<strong>How to get a horse to do a lead change</strong>. 
								
																	If she is not in the correct lead slow her down to a fast trot and ask her to lope in a. 
																	I would love to help. 
																	Riders cue their horses to encourage this sequence and quickly learn to recognize by sight and feel when a lead is wrong. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Im if the walkthrough isnt helpful but please ask me questions if you need to. 
																	Staying a little to the left of the 45-degree angle to the fence helps give my horse the space and freedom of movement she needs to achieve the lead change. 
																	Use her simple consistent plan to help your horse strengthen his weaker side and listen to your cues and hell get the correct lead every time you ask. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Fold or coil the excess lead rope in your left hand. 
																	Put a log or other small obstacle in the arena. 
																	Hold the lead rope with your right hand. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Some people advocate round pen work with dominant horses but make sure the area is large enough to give both you and the horse space. 
																	So youre signaling a left lead canter with your right hand and leg. 
																	Change often hand if your horse is not willing and concentrated enough. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The horse changes from a right lead canter to a left lead canter while staying on the same line. 
																	If I let my body and hands go to the right before my horse changes leads and directions Im blocking her from getting the lead change. 
																	When training know how much circle you want to turn left and how much to turn right etc. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Your inside hand and leg will automatically become the outside when your horse makes the lead change. 
																	The horse is to allow itself to be haltered. 
																	In a situation like this the horse can take over the lead easily.

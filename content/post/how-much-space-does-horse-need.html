						<h3 class="h5"><b>In small turnout pens its critical to pick manure daily have a well-thought-out manure management plan and divert clean water away from the dry lots.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much space does horse need</strong>. 
								
																	LEGALLY you need 1 and 12 acres for the first horse and 1 acre for each other horse. 
																	This amount of space provides enough room for the horse to move around freely and get adequate exercise. 
																	Obviously many people keep horses on smaller amounts of land and do not depend on the land to provide any forage. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A Warmblood or a small draft horse needs a space from 12 x 14 to 14 x 14. 
																	If group-feeding in a pasture setting DO arrange feed buckets in a circle at least 30 feet apart to give each horse space. 
																	An 1100-pound horse eating 15 percent to 20 percent of its body weight per day in hay would eat 165 to 220 pounds per day or in one year about 3 to 4 tons 100-120 bales of hay. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Where a roof or canopy is provided it should be high enough to avoid injuring a rider or fractious horse. 
																	If You Intend To Let The Horse Out To Pasture In all honesty I would think that the amount of space your horse needs really depends on its size. 
																	Horses need to be able to run and unwind and be horses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	In my mind its just barely enough but could work. 
																	DO put out an extra bucket of grain if feeding a group of four or more. 
																	The minimum area needed to house a horse for turnout is 01 one-tenth of an acre approximately 4500 square feet or 75 feet x 60 feet for an exercise lot. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You will need space for equipment and feed storage in your barn. 
																	So if you have say 3 horses you have to have at least 3 12 acres in total for them to graze on. 
																	Larger horses need wider trailers. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Box stalls for a horse should be an average of twelve feet by twelve feet. 
																	The area of pasture required per horse will depend on the type of grass ground conditions time of year type of horse and degree of pasture management employed. 
																	Trailers come in pony-to-draft horse size so choose according to the size of horses youll be hauling.

	<h1>How To Get A Horse To Do A Flying Change</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Always keep your horse calm and relaxed. My horse never switches his lead when cantering a figure eight and I cant canter him in a figure eight on the wrong lead in my arena because he is a stiff bodied horse in a small arena. Aids for flying changes realy does depend how your mare has been taught but if you just want to try it and see I would establish a nice bouncy fairly collected canter then change the rein in canter so that you end up in counter canter ask for canter on the correct rein so ask for canter dispite being in canter and see what you get. <br>

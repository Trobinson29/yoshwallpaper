													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to train your horse to come to you</strong>. 
								
																	The third thing you need consider is the horses temperament and his view of people. 
																	This should pull your horse out of his alert guarded pose and over time he will see that he can safely let his guard down around you. 
																	One way to train your horse to respect you is to establish your dominance by applying light pressure to its poll until it lowers its head. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Reinforcing positive behavior with food is the most common method. 
																	The horse must be confident and happy to be with youStep 2 Start with simple physical commands like body language and touching the horse. 
																	This isnt going to be an overnight process. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Have a good support system in case you get stuck. 
																	Teach the horse to see you as the leader - Horses are social animals and will look for a leader to follow. 
																	You should stop the horse and try again. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Initially this may take several minutes but keep practicing until your horse learns to quickly lower its head at a touch. 
																	Stand next to your horses head facing the same direction as he is. 
																	By putting a light contact on the lead rope and saying with your body language Im going to walk this way the horse will guess what to doStep 3 Gently correct any wrong action. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pick a horse that matches your CURRENT ability level. 
																	Make sure your horse knows how to stand on a mat and clicktreat as a reward. 
																	Ill provide you with details on that training here. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Gently guide the horses head down with you. 
																	By making sure you are their leader you will have an easier time getting them to obey you and trust you. 
																	Depending on your experience level you may need to work with a professional to begin training your horse but first get tips and advice on common horse behaviors and basic training techniques.

																	<strong>How to train a horse to take the correct lead</strong>. 
								
																	A properly trained horse will require only a slight nudge on one side to pick up the canter. 
																	See instructions for half halt or check in previous column Speed Up Slow Down. 
																	Additionally the rider should cue on the right side for the left lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Charles Wilhelm shows how to properly lead a horse. 
																	If you have access to a Pessoa training system and know how to use it properly longeing your horse in it can be helpful during this phase as well Every time he picks up the correct lead give him plenty of praise. 
																	Hold around the middle of the folds so that there are no loops around your hand. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Standing on the left-hand side near side of the horse hold the lead rope about 8 inches from the snap with your right hand. 
																	Hold the end of the lead rope folded to fit comfortably in your left hand. 
																	Practice asking him to pick up the left lead on the longe line or in a roundpen. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Practicing leg yields at the walk and trot helps your horse develop the suppleness and balance he needs to pick up the correct lead. 
																	How to Train A Horse to Get the Correct Lead. 
																	How you hold the lead rope is essential to safely leading your horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once you have your horse warmed up work him on a 20-meter circle in the trot. 
																	Contrary to what some may believe the rider should not kick as hard as they can with both legs to get the horse to canter. 
																	Jump into Canter - Intermediate or Advanced riders can use a small jump to help teach a stubborn or particularly one-sided horse to pick up the correct lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Walk your horse along the arena rail in a clockwise direction. 
																	Stay in posting trot until he is going nicely forward and is through in his body. 
																	If you are able to perform all of these exercises with your horse he should have not problem taking the correct lead every time.

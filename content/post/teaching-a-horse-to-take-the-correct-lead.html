	<h1>Teaching A Horse To Take The Correct Lead</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">You can use these tips whether youre working with a young horse thats still learning his leads or have a seasoned horse thats a little rusty. Ask the horse to back and pull down and back slightly with the lead rope. You should be able to ride a straight line with your horse well balanced and centered holding himself up and off of his front-end. <br>

																	<strong>Teaching a horse to take the correct lead</strong>. 
								
																	If you dont set the agenda for the things you do with and for your horse the horse will take over the lead. 
																	Also at this point in training you should be able to ask for the correct lead and get it. 
																	Ride with two hands on the reins so you can control each part of your horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Leg Yield Practicing leg yields at the walk and trot helps your horse develop the suppleness and balance he needs to pick up the correct lead. 
																	The question is about leading your horse and why Caroline teaches. 
																	This is a tactful way of saying that they pull on the inside rein. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The Set-Up The key to getting the correct lead every time is to set the. 
																	Set the jump at a height that will motivate the horse to take a small jump instead of trot over usually about 2ft place the jump several strides from the corner of a fenced arena trot towards the jump and the horse will naturally land in a canter. 
																	Jump into Canter - Intermediate or Advanced riders can use a small jump to help teach a stubborn or particularly one-sided horse to pick up the correct lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Here is the right way to lead a horse stand on the horses left side hold the end of the lead rope closest to the horses head in your right hand about 6 inches from the halter in your left hand hold the rest of the rope just folded up dont wrap it around your hand. 
																	Ask your horse to back up by turning around to face it. 
																	Theyre also key to your horses natural balance when hes loping. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Ill outline my steps for teaching a left-to-right lead change on one of my 3-year-old mares. 
																	But unless the rider has control of the horses outside shoulder the result is often not the desired one. 
																	As herd animals horses look to a leader to set the rules for the herd. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Switch the instructions to go from right to left. 
																	Once your horse has gotten used to the halter place it over its head and muzzle and attach the lead line. 
																	Charles Wilhelm shows how to properly lead a horse.

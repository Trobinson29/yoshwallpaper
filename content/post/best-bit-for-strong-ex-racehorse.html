	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">For young horses Heather recommends mouthpieces with a good weight bearing surface which then doesnt target a specific area. The Verbindend is one of Bit Banks top sellers- its available in the snaffle as in the link above as well as in pony sizes and as a bridoon. Use enough noseband to make your bit work For a strong horse if it is legal for your discipline try using a stronger noseband before you upgrade to a stronger bit. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Cheat Sheet 2- Bits for Starting or Retraining Horses.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>Best bit for strong ex racehorse</strong>. 
								
																	The picks have the best odds and Mels selections are based on the information compiled and executed. 
																	Remember the day the horse leaves the training yard its life is tipped upside down so that is when any behavioural or stress-related symptoms will kick in. 
																	In result of this the Waterford is a relatively strong and severe bit for a horse so is best to use for those very strong horses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The vast majority of ex-racehorses or any horses in work will be stabled through the winter months. 
																	The bit is only part of the overall corridor of aids you use to create the shapes you want the horse to take. 
																	Riders are realising the horses bit is equally important piece of tack. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	So we changed him to a ported mouth loose ring snaffle that allowed more tongue room. 
																	So do give your new horse time to adjust to its new lifestyle. 
																	Its a double jointed bit that is shaped to sit more like a single join in the mouth applying more concentrated pressure at the bars while being shaped to suit those horse with a fatter tongue. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Even a very strong bit wont help you control your horse if his mouth is open. 
																	Around 16mm thickness is idea. 
																	Well I used a Pelham on my thoroughbred when I evented and a Twisted Full-Cheek Snaffle when we went on the trails thats another English bit If your horse is well trained use a softer bit. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	So many riders dont understand that it isnt the bit that stops the horse. 
																	All horses are strong enough to pull a person out of the saddle. 
																	As a waterford restricts a horse from grabbing hold of the bit with their tongue and teeth it means they are unable to lean on the bit as the joints collapse and move around. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A horse that pulls runs away or goes faster than youd like to go is not fun to ride and a runaway horse can be dangerous. 
																	Controlling a strong horse may not be as simple as riding in a more severe bit. 
																	For most horses start with a 45 inch 1013cm bit and switch as necessary.

					<p align="justify">The result further supports the theory that as a meeting type drops from Provincial to Country the importance of leading increases. The amount of selections you bet on this horse racing system is determined by the odds of the favorite I have placed a table of odds below for you to show how many selections can be bet upon. Recent figures show them figuring in the first three placings about in 60 out of 100 races. <br>

																	<strong>What percentage of favourites win greyhound races</strong>. 
								
																	Favourites that have never won at the distance. 
																	Back in the old days 1980s it varied from track to track but usually hovered between 20 and 25. 
																	The favourite in a horse race is the shortest priced runner in the odds market. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The first favourites won 66 second favourites 56 third favs 32 fourth favs 34 fifth favs 30 and sixth favs 10. 
																	I saw a comment today on a greyhound handicapping forum noting that 35 of the betting favorites go on to win the race. 
																	Follow the information contained herein and stick to the rules and on average you will be leaving the bookies a winner 8 times out of 10. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Punter Stats - Australian Greyhound Racing Stats Win - Place overall data. 
																	The truth is that favourites having their first run at the distance or yet to win from multiple previous runs at the trip win only win one to two fewer races in every 100 compared to the average but the price the market offers about those horses provides much better returns. 
																	All race types All field sizes Custom Search Options Menu Home WinPlace Data. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Home - Help Information - Horse Racing Favourites Favourites Information Help. 
																	Total races in data 12626 Fav percentage Unitab fav. 
																	Punters are often wary of favourites on wet tracks but on the majority of metropolitan tracks they are actually profitable. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Do not try and alter the plan in any way as I can guarantee you will regret it. 
																	The favourites dont always come in but if you lay and 4 dogs win out of 12 races between 21 and 31 that can wipe out your profit. 
																	You have to figure out a few filters such as avoiding downgrades in class. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Since all dogs are favuored by someone and there are 8 dogs per race then the percentage of favourites that win races is 125. 
																	Doing this brings the number of races to 269 with 2967 runners and the outcome is interesting. 
																	This is a clear indication that backing favourites for a place can be worthwhile.

						<h3 class="h5"><b>Watch as we show you how I go about halter breaking a colt.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to halter train your foal</strong>. 
								
																	It is a good idea to buy one that can be let out quite a bit as your foal will grow very fast. 
																	Then reach over the neck with your right hand grabbing ahold of the crown piece and slide the nose piece down to the foals nose in an effort to snare the nose. 
																	If you do not halter-break your horse you will not be able to handle him or do anything with him at all. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once the foal is happily accepting you touching its head start rubbing the halter over its face and body and let it sniff it so it becomes comfortable with the new object. 
																	Halter training your weanling. 
																	Your foal should be very friendly and should trust you fully. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Yesterday we worked with the halter and rope after an hour in the morning 20 min in the heat of the day 98 degrees in Texas and 12 hour in the evening she was standing still and accepting the rope all over her body and even still perfectly still to have the halter put on her face and tied I use rope halters. 
																	Make sure that the halter is a good fit and is not loose enough to snag or catch on anything. 
																	Within a few days of birth it is essential to place a halter on a foals head so that he gets used to having it on as early as possible in his life. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Foals often scratch their ears and face with a back hoof and a hoof can get caught in the halter. 
																	The hardest part on training your horse is getting their neck to stretch and their ears to perk. 
																	Joins us while we introduce Scarlet to a halter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	My focus here is on the In Hand classes we encounter at horse show events and Im going to cover a broad spectrum including how to prepare for the different variations of classes what the judges will be looking for how to train and exhibit your horse and a brief explanation of the various sub-categories of Halter classes in existence today. 
																	Make sure your filly has learned to walk freely on the lead and can stand square on command. 
																	That way you can maintain control of the foals head and neck while quickly placing the halter on its head. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The newborn foal is programmed for soaking up a huge amount of information immediately after birth. 
																	Step 1 Introduce the halter to your foal when he is anywhere from three days old to a weekStep 2 Make sure that you buy a halter that will fit well. 
																	I will also talk about some of the dos and don.

	<h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 Does The White Arabian Horse Respawn</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">The horse respawns when it dies. If you spook it itll run away but you can still catch it on your horse. This happened to me in Saint Denis while I was being followed by lawmen they killed my White Arabian horse which is bad I respawned with a Tennessee Walker as my main horse and drove it to the Saint Denis stable where I bought the Black Arabian horse that is almost a copy of the White Arabian and has slightly better stats also it would be interesting to have a collection of Arabian horses. <br>

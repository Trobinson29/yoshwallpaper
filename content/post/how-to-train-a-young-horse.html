					<p align="justify">This helps build acceptance of the contact. Pinned ears bared teeth and swishing tails go a long way in disciplining youngsters. A lot of horses live in 10- by 10-foot pens and suddenly theyre put out on the side of a mountain somewhere with little or no preparation whatsoever. <br>

																	<strong>How to train a young horse</strong>. 
								
																	The fifth thing to do when you want to learn how to train a horse is to keep a good written training plan and follow it. 
																	Once your horse is old enough to start training you must use ground work before ever attempting to ride. 
																	My favorite kind of bit for young horses is an eggbutt snaffle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Try some awkward turns and then increase the poles to little jumps if you feel like your horse is ready. 
																	Longeing or ground training with a long rope is the first step. 
																	Dressage trainer and rider Tor Van Den Berge explains basic training and exercise concepts that you can introduce to a young Dressage horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If your horse tends to be a bit mouthy and nips teaching a horse to give a kiss upon the cheek might not be safe so find an alternative that keeps the kisses away from the handlers face. 
																	For me this language starts on the gr. 
																	This is when many horses begin their careers and can handle the advanced training of demanding sports like jumping dressage distance riding polo and other high speed high impact or physically demanding work. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The longe line attaches to the horses halter and allows it a large circle of movement while you teach it commands. 
																	The decision as to when to begin training with the young horse including that aspect of training that would involve riding is in fact relatively subjective. 
																	Dont wait until you have a 1500-pound giant on your hands before teaching your young horse manners and simple tasks. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Two simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses. 
																	In dressage the terms stretching and collection appear at very different stages of a horses training. 
																	Pasture turnout with big boy horses is a great way for your yearling to stretch his legs and learn to socialize with his own kind. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Handling his ears working with his feet teaching him to load on a trailer be tied and to stand still for fly spray are all excellent things to do with your impressionable equine friend. 
																	It is important for the young horse to move in proper posture by encouraging the back to lift underneath the riders weight. 
																	At the ranch Clinton and his staff begin each horses training by imprinting the foals at birth establishing trust and teaching them the basics of leading and haltering.

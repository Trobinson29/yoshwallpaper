	<h1>How To Teach Your Horse To Catch You</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">A common problem that many horse owners have is dealing with a horse that doesnt want to be caught. Just carry it as you usually would and let it hang over your arm. Teach your horse to stand quietly while you clean their hooves or while the farrier works with them. <br>

																	<strong>How to teach your horse to catch you</strong>. 
								
																	Without confidence and relaxation you really dont have much at all. 
																	Whether you ride English or western its handy to have a horse that can both direct rein and neck reinIts also fun to teach your horse unique tricks and even non-horse people enjoy watching horses perform themTwo simple tricks are giving hugs and kisses. 
																	This is particularly frustrating when the horse will allow itself to be caught some days but not others or will come for the barn manager but not for his owner. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Carina Maiwald Getty Images Its easy and fun to teach your horse to neck rein. 
																	Instead of walking up to your horse walk into the area where he is and step in front of him to capture his attention when you are some distance away. 
																	The reason a horse does or doesnt want to be caught is basically about the relationship between the owner and the horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Walking your horse or leading is a daily activity for a horse ownerA horse must have basic leading skills before you can expect it to be trained to ride drive or any other activity. 
																	Whether youre catching a horse teaching a foal to lead mounting for the first time or teaching advanced movements every horse must be confident and relaxed before he can learn. 
																	This ground manner makes cleaning and trimming time much less stressful and less painful for all involved. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This way they will learn that coming to you doesnt always mean work. 
																	Dont place their halter on them too frequently early on. 
																	When you are done dont let your horse conclude the exchange. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its up to us to teach them. 
																	Use your knowledge of what your horse likes. 
																	If your horse turns her hindquarters towards you or runs away when you walk towards her push her around. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Along with all the more serious stuff I do with my horses I love to teach tricks. 
																	If your horse tends to be a bit mouthy and nips. 
																	Separate your horse from the rest of the herd by pushing him or her out of the group.

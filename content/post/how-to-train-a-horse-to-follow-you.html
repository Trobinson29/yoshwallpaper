																	<strong>How to train a horse to follow you</strong>. 
								
																	13 Ways to Establish and Confirm Leadership Straightness Training is most effective when the horse sees you as a leader because as a result your horse will follow you respect you trust you feel safe and he will be willing and cooperative. 
																	Gently guide the horses head down with you. 
																	But before we dive into the concepts of leadership and dominance first some points to note. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Teach your horse that your presence is good by using groundwork. 
																	You may need to give the horse some mental inertia by rocking forward in the saddle as you give it other cues to move forward. 
																	Once your horse has gotten used to the halter place it over its head and muzzle and attach the lead line. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Get your horse to follow you in new environments with different obstacles. 
																	While holding the rope lift the pole with both arms take care to bend your knees as you lift it to avoid pulling your back - no injuries please. 
																	Alternate having your horse come to you and putting on their halter with having them come and then releasing them. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Teach your horse walking away from you is wrong. 
																	This should pull your horse out of his alert guarded pose and over time he will see that he can safely let his guard down around you. 
																	To train a horse to lead start by petting your horses head so it gets used to being touched where the halter will go. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This also means that as soon as your horse responds correctly to what you ask them to do you make a big fuss and give much praise. 
																	For instance if the horse you are training has never worn a bridle it would be a good smaller goal to introduce and have him be comfortable with things like. 
																	Dont place their halter on them too frequently early on. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Hold the lead rope in your hand and slowly bend down at the waist with your head down. 
																	Then rub the halter over its face and let it sniff it. 
																	Start by having your horse come close to you and rewarding them verbally and with a treat.

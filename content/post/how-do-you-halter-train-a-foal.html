	<h1>How Do You Halter Train A Foal</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">The halter sometimes known as the headcollar is the harness that you will place over the horses head around the muzzle and up over the poll and ears. Its amazing how quickly the foal gains strength and I just found it easier to control movement while putting the halter onthen just observing while the foal wore it a whilejust sit and observe the foal getting used to wearing this thing on its face for 20 minutes to an hour on day 1. Your foal should be very friendly and should trust you fully. <br>

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How do you halter train a foal</strong>. 
								
																	If not you should gain his trust before you try to teach him to lead or he could get scared and loose any trust that he had with you beforeStep 3 Learn the first haltering lessons. 
																	So to train a donkey it is very different from training a horse. 
																	Let him wear it around while at pasture with his dam. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If youd like to truly show off your horse at horse show you cant do much better than to enter him in a halter class. 
																	My cousin trains barrel horses and uses a similar technique. 
																	Other horses will do a lot of foal training for you. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If I so much as Lift the rope to put around his neck He trots off briskly. 
																	OK but what you do when you cant catch the horse in order to put the rope around his neck in order to halter him. 
																	You must be slow. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once the halter is on Clay uses a steady light contact pressure on the lead rope until the foal shows ANY sort of sign of yielding to the pressure. 
																	To start the relationship with the foal and the lead line first clip a lead line to his halter. 
																	A foal should learn to walk quietly beside the handler. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Foals can stick their heads through gaps in fencing or stall walls that a larger horse wouldnt catching the halter and becoming entangled. 
																	Step 1 Introduce the halter to your foal when he is anywhere from three days old to a weekStep 2 Make sure that you buy a halter that will fit well. 
																	My horse never wants to come in from the pasture where hes eating and as soon as I start to approach him he moves away. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If the weanling has been getting grain in a separate stall from its mother it will already be prepared for spending short periods alone. 
																	This ground-based class might appear a bit like showmanship at first but unlike that class halter judging is all about the horse. 
																	It is a good idea to buy one that can be let out quite a bit as your foal will grow very fast.

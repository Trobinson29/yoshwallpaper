																	<strong>How to start training a baby horse</strong>. 
								
																	From the start this gives us a great opportunity to get a horses future right or wrong. 
																	The way other horses can approach this training can sometimes seem a bit harsh. 
																	Because they are born learners foals can learn both the positive and the negative equally. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once your horse is comfortable in the halter you can begin training him to lead. 
																	A good time to start barrel training is when the horse is about five years old. 
																	Take hold of the remaining line in your left hand. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Before ever showing your horse a barrel get it used to loping in circles and figure eights in the pasture. 
																	Because we understand what motivates different behaviors in horses so much better than we once did much of the brute force of traditional horse training equipment has gone out of training. 
																	Break your training goals down into manageable sections and write down the smaller milestones and time frame when you can reach them. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Standing on the left hand side of your horse take the line in your right hand and hold it a foot or two away from his chin. 
																	By making sure you are their leader you will have an easier time getting them to obey you. 
																	When it comes to starting a horse the term used to describe training a horse under saddle there is no rush to master all the steps at once. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Youngsters are too unpredictable and knowledge timing and skill are required for success. 
																	Teach the horse to see you as the leader - Horses are social animals and will look for a leader to follow. 
																	This is done by holding the foot up for a few seconds and putting it down again. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Horse training can be fun but it also can be quite a challengeFor the beginner its probably best to leave starting young horses to more experienced trainers. 
																	Foals should learn early what it is like to have their feet handled especially if corrective trimming may be needed. 
																	In fact if you master all these steps in one day you probably missed something that youre going to have to go back and correct later.

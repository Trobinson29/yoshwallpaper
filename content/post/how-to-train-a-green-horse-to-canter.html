						<h3 class="h5"><b>In time if you do it enough the horse will eventually start to canter just at the word just like a well trained lesson horse will begin to canter when the instructor says the word instead of when the rider asks.</b></h3>

																	<strong>How to train a green horse to canter</strong>. 
								
																	Preserve that feeling as you begin the counter-canter. 
																	The canter is a slow collected gallop developed over time through training. 
																	Concentrate on the feel of the cues holding your horse on the right lead. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The next step is strengthening your horses canter on the longe line. 
																	Once your horse is comfortable at a trot both posting and sitting and youre comfortable stopping and going you can start to teach your horse how to canter Please follow and like us. 
																	By using that point you can begin to get control without even touching the horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its usually in a corner because the turn brings the horses inside hind leg up under him. 
																	Once your horse is comfortable at a trot both posting and sitting and youre comfortable stopping and going you can start to teach your horse how to canter. 
																	Bud explains those benefits and demonstrates how to teach a green horse the counter canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Rarely do you look out into a pen full of horses and see them making slow bendy circles at the canter. 
																	This means the horses inside front leg is the most free which means he will pick up the canter on this leg by default. 
																	Sit and use a half halt to balance the horse and help him to load the outside hind leg which will be the leg that starts the canter depart. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When the lope is established guide him smoothly off the circle into an open area of your work space where you can make a similar circle to the left. 
																	Give a subtle squeeze with your inside leg at the girth and your outside leg just behind the girth. 
																	Cantering in harness gives the horse the opportunity to canter without the added stress of a nervous rider. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Five Canter Hacks for Green Horses and Green Riders The natural gaits of the horse are walk trot and gallop. 
																	There is a point in your positioning relative to an unsure horse that will cause him to want to go forwards away from you or backwards away from you. 
																	Your outside leg is moved behind the girth which causes the horses haunches to move to the inside.

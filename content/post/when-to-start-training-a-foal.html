					<p align="justify">Should you just leave him alone with other horses in the pasture until he is 2 3 years old or should you already start doing something with him once per week before that. Until science becomes a good deal more advanced in this area there are only a few benchmarks available to us which are based on objective proven science. If you have foal you have probably been wondering when should you start working with him. <br>

																	<strong>When to start training a foal</strong>. 
								
																	The average age a horse fully matures both mentally and physically is 4-5 years. 
																	EFT is the best possible place to begin to raise an intelligent and willing companion horse Trick Horse or Exhibition Horse. 
																	Horse training and the horse training equipment used for horse training has changed dramatically over the last 20-30 years. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The newborn foal is programmed for soaking up a huge amount of information immediately after birth. 
																	Sending a colt that is afraid of people to a professional trainer will be more stressful for the colt and will take the trainer more time to. 
																	Although you can start a horse under saddle before 4 or 5 years of age its important to remember they are still developing at that age and therefore your training regimen must not be too severe for their developing bodies to handle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Since my training using positive reinforcement has been so successful with my older. 
																	Enhanced Foal Training helps to instill correct behavior in the horse from the very beginning. 
																	When its time to start the colt under saddle as a 2-year-old things will go much better if he is well mannered and respects people but is not afraid of them. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The decision as to when to begin training with the young horse including that aspect of training that would involve riding is in fact relatively subjective. 
																	The first thing to look at when learning how to train a horse is your experience level when riding and handling horses. 
																	Foals should learn early what it is like to have their feet handled especially if corrective trimming may be needed. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Foal training is such an important beginning to your foals future and good training will establish a relationship while also teaching your foal the basics to cope with the domestic life of a horse. 
																	Here are a. 
																	Training Foals and Weanlings. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	From the start this gives us a great opportunity to get a horses future right or wrong. 
																	Because we understand what motivates different behaviors in horses so much better than we once did much of the brute force of traditional horse training equipment has gone out of training. 
																	As the foal learns to accept the handling and learns to balance the length of time can be increased.

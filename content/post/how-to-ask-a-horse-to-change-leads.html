						<h3 class="h5"><b>The command can be as simple as a flick of the appropriate wrist.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to ask a horse to change leads</strong>. 
								
																	As a jockey cant use his leg length like an exercise rider would he will use the reins and slightly. 
																	Staying a little to the left of the 45-degree angle to the fence helps give my horse the space and freedom of movement she needs to achieve the lead change. 
																	Give a little squeeze with your inside leg on the girth to tell your horse to go forward into the canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its easier if you have a pole on the ground. 
																	Canter over the log and apply the leg cues for the lead change as your horse hops over it. 
																	Before attempting to ask your horse for a proper change consult with your trainer to make sure your horse is ready to accept this challenging work. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Clear aids and communication is key and the learning process should never be rushed. 
																	The method I am most comfortable with is with a lateral movement so if I am in the left lead I would ask for the change to the right by pushing them off my left leg onto the right lead. 
																	You reverse your cues to ask for the bend in the opposite direction and you should change leads. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	- relax the pressure of your right leg that is holding the horse to the left this invites the horse to the right and move your right seat bone forward - apply your left leg behind the cinch to ask for the change just as you would for a lope depart. 
																	If I let my body and hands go to the right before my horse changes leads and directions Im blocking her from getting the lead change. 
																	Ask your horse to return to a collected sitting trot making sure you stay centered in your saddle while keeping him straight. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Canter your horse down the diagonal and ask for a change in bend in the center while puttping your new outside leg back a bit. 
																	DO ask your horse to drop to a jog before you reach the marker or your chosen spot for a simple change. 
																	DONT forget that your form matters throughout the patternno leaning forward or backward during the change. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	You can also jump over a low bush if you are riding outside of the arena. 
																	Keep the horse positioned to the inside as you did above. 
																	When you ask for the canter depart push your inside seat bone forward toward your horses inside ear.

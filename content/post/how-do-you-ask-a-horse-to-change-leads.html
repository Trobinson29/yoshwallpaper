	<h1>How Do You Ask A Horse To Change Leads</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Timing the lead change. The method I am most comfortable with is with a lateral movement so if I am in the left lead I would ask for the change to the right by pushing them off my left leg onto the right lead. To start the lead-change work I lope a left-lead circle. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>It helps to slow down the canter with a few collecting half halts before you pull back on the reins to ask your horse to transition to a walk.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How do you ask a horse to change leads</strong>. 
								
																	But I will tell you how I do it when Im riding english. 
																	Ask for the correct lead again trying to be as precise as you can with your seat leg and hand aids. 
																	You reverse your cues to ask for the bend in the opposite direction and you should change leads. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	She also should move away from calf pressure. 
																	After the horse makes the change you can initiate the new bend. 
																	The proper sequence of using your legs and hands to ask for the lead change in a way your horse can understand. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Jockeys often give horses a cue to change leads often with a flick of the wrist andor shifting of weight and many horses learn to change automatically. 
																	The command can be as simple as a flick of the appropriate wrist. 
																	What your horse should know before you start to seriously ask him for lead changes. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Then ask for the lope. 
																	Her response will immediately tell you if you have enough control over her body to ask for a lead change. 
																	Sit squarely and draw your horse back into the trot. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When my horse is responsive I transition my loping circle to a straight diagonal line toward about where the third cone would be in a reining pattern about â…” of the way down the arena. 
																	DO ask your horse to drop to a jog before you reach the marker or your chosen spot for a simple change. 
																	You can also progress to making a lead change from canter to a walk and then back to canter. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	To perfect your aids for this practice making canter departures first from the trot which is easier because your horse has more impulsion to carry into the transition then from the walk asking him to respond to soft aids the first time you ask. 
																	He uses the reins to steer the horse a little to the right then back to the left and then a more abrupt signal to the right. 
																	How to get control of your horses head neck shoulders and hindquarters.

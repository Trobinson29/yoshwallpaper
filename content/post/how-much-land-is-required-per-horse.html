	<h1>How Much Land Is Required Per Horse</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">In the UK we can take 1 -15 acres per horse providing the field is flat and the sub surface relatively hard and horses have not turned the field sour. A ranch or small farm in the southwest may only provide a 20 x 40 run for a horse yet those horses remain as healthy as horses running in a 40-acre field Yoder said. I usually like to have 100 acres per 20-stall barn but thats for a thoroughbred breeding operation with three 25-acre fields in operation with one resting Factors to consider when choosing your land to board or raise horses on. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>BHS say that to keep a horse out 247 all year round without needing to feed extra hay you need 15 acres for the first horse and 1 acre per horse after that.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much land is required per horse</strong>. 
								
																	Horses are like magnets to people walking past and especially children. 
																	According to Washington State Universitys Managing Small-Acreage Horse Farms the minimum recommended space in a dry lot is 400 square feet per horse although a larger space would be more desirable. 
																	Where a roof or canopy is provided it should be high enough to avoid injuring a rider or fractious horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	But good management means that the field must be kept free of dung by collection and that the field should be divided up with electrified tape especially in the grass growing season. 
																	Minnesota Statutes 604A12 Subd4. 
																	Tennessee requires 2 acres per horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	However this recommendation can only ever be a guide as there are many factors affecting this such as. 
																	In smaller turnout pens its critical to remove manure frequently to avoid a buildup which can attract flies or produce an odor. 
																	In general professionals recommend two acres for the first horse and an additional acre for each additional horse eg five acres for four horses. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Provision also needs to be made for every part of the pasture to be rested for at least six weeks twice a year. 
																	Minimum Land Requirements The BHS recommends a ratio of one horse per 04 - 06 hectares on permanent grazing 1- 15 acres per horse. 
																	For physical well-being horses do not require room to run only move around freely for at least a portion of every day. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	With non-irrigated dryland pastures you may need up to 30-38 acres per horse to meet its total forage needs. 
																	Minnesota - Signs are required to be posted but there is no Contractual Language required in Release Forms. 
																	KEEPING TOO MANY HORSES IN A SMALL FIELD - OVERGRAZING. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The rule of thumb for Texas is 1 acre per horse but in Fort Worth for instance requires 10000 square feet of land per large animal and the animal must be kept 50 feet away from a regulated structure and with a quarter mile of the owners if the owner does not live on the property. 
																	The general rule is to allow at least one and a half acres of grazing for the first horse and one acre for each horse or pony after that. 
																	One acre is 43560 square feet or approximately 210 feet x 210 feet.

	<h1>Teaching A Young Horse To Pick Up Its Feet</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">In most cases If the horse refuses to pick up a certain foot its usually the opposite foot that would have the problemWhen the horse shifts its weight to pick up the hoof the extra weight on the opposite side may cause more pain and discomfort that would make the horse not want to. In a perfect world a horse will have been schooled from day one to lift its feet up and set them down as requested but we dont live in that world. Do not attempt to lift his leg up. <br>

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>Teaching a young horse to pick up its feet</strong>. 
								
																	In this video I am working with one of my school masters Sundance. 
																	To begin with the youngster should be familiar with the handler running the hands gently but firmly down each leg not necessarily asking for the foot to be lifted. 
																	This is a great time to get your yearling ready for his future farrier work. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Janet Farrow New Hampshire. 
																	Patrick was rescued from a neglectful home and is a very introvert. 
																	Repeat several times if necessary. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	How do you teach a horse to pick up its feet when jumping. 
																	In this video a yearling stud colt is taught to have his feet handled for the first time. 
																	How Pain Affects the Horse. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A The average horse weighs 1200 pounds. 
																	When your horse lifts his foot hold and support the fetlock and hoof with both hands. 
																	Butte Creek Ranch boss Scott DePaolo explains how to get your horse to lift its feet for you so you can use a hoof pick to clean rocks out of its hoof. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	He recently got sold to my barn and I dont think anyone who owned him before worked on it with him and Id like to teach him so I canpick his feet out once in a while. 
																	So Ive been riding this young horse and its really hard to get him to pick up his feet. 
																	Instead of trying to pick up 300 pounds teach your horse to pick up his feet for you by using your horses natural tendency to seek relief. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When a horse has pain in its body it may be hesitant to pick up its feet. 
																	Its rare but he does pick them up if your strong enough to pull that hard. 
																	Whenever you get him out pick up your yearlings feet and hold them making sure he doesnt rest his weight on you or stomp his feet down.

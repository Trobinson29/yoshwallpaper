	<h1>How Do You Teach A Young Horse To Jump</h1>

	
	
	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Developing a good technique and being consistent in training sessions means that it will become natural for your horse to jump in a nice soft rounded shape no matter what height the fence. You must be able to help him stay in balance too. If he rushes to the next obstacle halt him after each jump until he learns to not speed off. <br>

																	<strong>How do you teach a young horse to jump</strong>. 
								
																	Teach Me Join. 
																	If you allow this youre teaching your horse how to say no. 
																	Go with your horse however green his effort. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once your horse has a feel for going over a jump and knows where to put his feet take away the trotting poles and set up five or six individual jumps around the arena. 
																	Once they have become comfortable with this you can begin incrementally increasing the height of the jumps. 
																	If your lower leg has a tendency to slip back it could be because you throw your upper body over the horse as you jump causing the momentum to slide your lower leg backwards. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The bascule or curl is the shape that the horse makes over a fence and is another key skill for the successful show jumper. 
																	Just as horses prefer to drift in one direction more than the other the horse that habitually runs out at a jump tends to do it in one direction too. 
																	You can train your horse to jump by having them first become comfortable trotting and cantering over ground poles then slowly working your way towards a small jump over a cross rail. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	The worst run-out scenario is the horse that has learned to eagerly approach the jump and then at the last instant drop his shoulder duck to the outside of the jump and then scurry off. 
																	If your horse questions a jump never let him turn away and reapproach the fence. 
																	My motto is however you feel comfortable doing it. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	This ground manner makes cleaning and trimming time much less stressful and less painful for all involved. 
																	So how can you train your horse to jump. 
																	In this video I share several key ob. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It is not an exercise for young fresh or difficult horses. 
																	This will teach your horse to keep going at a controlled pace after each jump. 
																	Start with coloured poles on the floor building up from one to a row of five approx 1m apart.

	<div class="navi text-center">
					<p align="justify">Here are a few tips that can help you successfully complete this important step. It is a good idea to buy one that can be let out quite a bit as your foal will grow very fast. Make sure that the halter is a good fit and is not loose enough to snag or catch on anything. <br>

						<h3 class="h5"><b>We start as early as possible usually once they are weaned but halter training is usually it for training until they hit a year and then we start ground work.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>When can you halter train a foal</strong>. 
								
																	Light backing at 2 turned out again til 3 and then at 3 we start to put some miles on. 
																	It will depend on the health of mare and foal growth rate and other factors. 
																	For his sake and yours halter breaking is a must-do early training task. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It is common to place a halter on a foal when it is just a few days old. 
																	You want to keep the mare close in the area so she can help comfort the foal but you need to keep her from stressing during the foals training. 
																	Even a foal should learn certain. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Use a halter that fits well and is not too loose as the foal will probably paw at it and could get a foot hung in a loose strap. 
																	Once the halter is on Clay uses a steady light contact pressure on the lead rope until the foal shows ANY sort of sign of yielding to the pressure. 
																	With assistance you should be able to slip the halter onto the foals nose and set the buckle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Use a leather halter or one with a breakaway crown piece for safety. 
																	Once the foal knows the series then hes turned out in a pasture and just allowed to be a horse. 
																	Weaning can take place any time after 3 months of age although many breeders believe it is healthier for mare and foal if it is left as late as possible. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If not you should gain his trust before you try to teach him to lead or he could get scared and loose any trust that he had with you beforeStep 3 Learn the first haltering lessons. 
																	A small foal halter can be put on but it can be a hazard to leave it on if youre not present. 
																	A Rope Halter needs to be tied properly - 90 percent of the time you will see them tied wrong. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	When tied wrong a horse can get loose the end of the rope can interfere with training and will slap and pop your horse in the eye and the knot will NOT untie easy. 
																	Within the first day or two youll want to put a halter on the foal. 
																	Foals can stick their heads through gaps in fencing or stall walls that a larger horse wouldnt catching the halter and becoming entangled.

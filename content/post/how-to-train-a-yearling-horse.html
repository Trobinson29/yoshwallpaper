					<p align="justify">Curmudgeonly old geldings or strict broodmares are usually great etiquette teachers as long as they arent known kickers. In addition to target training the yearlings learned to yield to pressureto back up in the bridlewhen we placed pressure on the halter to back up when we placed pressure on the chest and to step laterally or swing the haunches out when we applied pressure to the opposite side. Progress up to 20-30 minutes five days per week for a good 30-60 days before breaking. <br>

																	<strong>How to train a yearling horse</strong>. 
								
																	Handling and training a yearling is no small or easy commitment they are much more challenging than an older horse that has already been at least partway trained. 
																	The best thing I can suggest is that you find a trainer to work with you and the yearlings. 
																	For yearlings and onwards we recommend the Fundamentals Series. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	It is important that a young horse not be overworked to protect the joints in its legs and back. 
																	Training horses is most successfully done in layersteach one step and build on that until the lesson is complete. 
																	Expose your yearling to all sorts of things use your imagination be creative. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Use tarps poles I also like to use a makeshift 6wooden bridge to walk over. 
																	But a horse under the age of two should not carry any weight. 
																	Teach your horse to lunge. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	While weve put up literally hundreds of documents on horse behavior gentling and training in the KBR Training Section it can all get a bit overwhelming. 
																	Foals between the age of 3 and 9 months are at greatest risk for developmental orthopedic disorders. 
																	So they just practice getting them haltered maybe pick up the feet and then turn them out in pasture until they are 2 or 3 years old then begin training. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I also like to teach my yearlings to walk through water especially when it rains. 
																	Very short training sessions on the lunge line or in the round pen can begin. 
																	Young growing horses need a diet ratio of Ca to P between 1 to 1 and 3 to 1. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	How to train a yearling horse - Preparing a young horse for the saddle Most people have no idea how to train a yearling horse or what to do with them. 
																	Develop some early condition with a program of handwalking or ponying and teach them to ground drive. 
																	For horses younger than a year old we recommend using the Foal Training Series because it goes into great detail on how to imprint a foal teach him basic leading lessons and how to start the Fundamentals exercises.

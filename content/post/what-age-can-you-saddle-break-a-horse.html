						<h3 class="h5"><b>In my experience horses who are 3 or 4 years old are at the prime age to start ridingtheyre old enough to mentally and physically handle the work but theyre usually not yet strong enough to resist horribly and they havent become too set in their ways to learn.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>What age can you saddle break a horse</strong>. 
								
																	They are broken to ride starting around 18 months of age so that they are ready to race as 2 year olds. 
																	That way I can tell them where the horse is what needs to be worked on then let them do their stuff. 
																	John Strassburger esteemed horseman and journalist believes that depending on the individual horse three to four years of age is a safe time to start training a horse under saddle. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Typically people will put them under saddle lightly at the age of 6. 
																	So when you have a horse beginning to drop the nose stiffen the forelegs and shift their weight forward then you know bucking is about to happen. 
																	But it can be done when theyre younger or older if you do it progressively. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Young horses this age are physically mature and ready to learn. 
																	Pick one or the other. 
																	I do not saddle break horses anymore bad back left knee but I want them well started when they go to the trainer. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Clydes dont fully mature til the age of 8 at least. 
																	Contrary to the belief of some when preparing a horse for saddle our goal is not to break a horses spirit but rather to create a. 
																	Perhaps the ideal age to breed a mare for the first time is when she is 3 to foal at 4 or 4 to foal at 5. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I generally dont ride young horses until they are 2 12 years old usually the fall of their two year old year for only a few rides just to give them the idea of what will come later. 
																	The Fatal Flaw Behind Horse Breaking By Jeffrey Rolo. 
																	When you have accomplished all of that you can saddle and bridle the horse in his two year old year and continue the longeing training and even add long-lining. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	If you have a foal or horse younger than 4 or 5 years old dont worry about riding and focus on building trust and confidence through simple leading and grooming. 
																	Do this even if the horse is already broken but it is new to you. 
																	At this age a horse is generally physically and mentally ready to handle the work yet still young enough to learn.

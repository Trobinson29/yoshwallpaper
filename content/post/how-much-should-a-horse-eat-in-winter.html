						<h3 class="h5"><b>In the winter horses will consume 10 to 12 gallons of water per day.</b></h3>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How much should a horse eat in winter</strong>. 
								
																	It is recommended that horses receive a minimum of 15 of their body weight in dry forage per day. 
																	It could be in the form of long stem hay chopped hays forage based cubes or combinations thereof. 
																	This depends on the horses activity and the quality of the food. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Ideally the water temperature should be at 50-65 F to encourage drinking. 
																	Being cold and wet is very chilling and a horse will eat a lot more to keep warm. 
																	Our mares have free choice hay all year. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	A horse should eat one to two percent of their body weight in roughage every day. 
																	Horses who spend much of their time in stalls arent doing much grazing but their natural feeding patterns can be replicated by keeping hay in front of them for most of the day. 
																	Because of the higher energycalorie level of grass this is more than a matter of curiosity. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	They should also have access to salt at all times and unlimited ice free water. 
																	Depending on how much work you do with your horse some forage may be replaced by concentrate feed. 
																	A 500kg horse can typically eat around 6-8kg or more of forage in the winter months alongside grazing. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Left to their own devices a horse consuming 25 of its body weight of pasture with an average energy level of 226 Mcalkg would gain a full body condition score in 30 days. 
																	Make sure your horses water doesnt freeze over in winter temperatures. 
																	However 2 or more may be appropriate during cold weather especially if your horses live outdoors. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Its recommended that you add an additional 2 pounds of hay for every 10 degrees F drop in temperature below 32 degrees. 
																	A horse in general at maintenance level in mild months should consume between 15-25 of their body weight in hay each day. 
																	An average adult horse should eat dry matter what remains after all of the water is evaporated out of a feed weighing around 153 per cent of its body weight.

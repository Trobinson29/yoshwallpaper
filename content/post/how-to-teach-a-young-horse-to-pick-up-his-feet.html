					<p align="justify">When your horse lifts his foot hold and support the fetlock and hoof with both hands. As soon as the horse responds by taking his weight off his leg immediately release the pressure and rub his leg. On the back legs the cue for the horse to pick up his foot is to lightly squeeze the cap of his hock. <br>

													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
																	<strong>How to teach a young horse to pick up his feet</strong>. 
								
																	And when shes ready you can pick up the foot again. 
																	Your farrier will thank you if the horse understands that it must keep its own foot in the air. 
																	If Im riding for example each time I dismount I walk around and pick up all four hooves and hold them for a bit. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	As soon as the horse lifts his leg put it down and give him a stroke. 
																	If the horse picks the foot up but then leans it on you let go for a second without dropping it or drop the foot completely if the horse is really rude and then support again. 
																	When you have the horse picking his front and hind legs up off the ground then practice holding each leg up. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Once he does pick up his foot immediately release the pressure and begin rubbing his leg again so he relaxes and puts his foot on the ground. 
																	If your horse still does not shift his weight or pick up his foot gently rock your shoulder into his upper leg rocking on and off. 
																	Horses usually pick this up very quickly if you first show them how to do it unmounted. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Begin picking up his feet. 
																	And an owner pulling and pushing to try to lift the immobile limb is the picture of frustration. 
																	To end foot-lifting battles once and for all step back for a moment and consider why your horse may not want you to handle his hoof. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	Pinch or twist your horses chestnut just enough to make him notice and lift his foot in response. 
																	The key to making the horse stand when you pick the feet up is you cant hold the foot up very long. 
																	Pick up a leg when hes straddled out and he could lose his balance as well as his hoof-handling confidence. 
															</p>
													<p class="p-2" align="justify">
								
																	I find the best thing you can do is just let her put it down. 
																	Repeat several times if necessary. 
																	For the front legs run your hand down to just behind the knee and while standing a little to the side gently pull forward.
